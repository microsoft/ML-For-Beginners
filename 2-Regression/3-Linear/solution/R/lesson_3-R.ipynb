        "Now you are ready to dive deeper into regression for ML. In this lesson, you will learn more about two types of regression: *basic linear regression* and *polynomial regression*, along with some of the math underlying these techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Throughout this curriculum, we assume minimal knowledge of math, and seek to make it accessible for students coming from other fields, so watch for notes, 🧮 callouts, diagrams, and other learning tools to aid in comprehension.\n",

        "\n",
        "In the previous lesson, you created a `tibble` (a modern reimagining of the data frame) and populated it with part of the original dataset, standardizing the pricing by the bushel. By doing that, however, you were only able to gather about 400 data points and only for the fall months. Maybe we can get a little more detail about the nature of the data by cleaning it more? We'll see... 🕵️‍♀️\n",

The term `least-squares` means that all the data points surrounding the regression line are squared and then added up. Ideally, that final sum is as small as possible, because we want a low number of errors, or `least-squares`. As such, the line of best fit is the line that gives us the lowest value for the sum of the squared errors - hence the name *least squares regression*.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
