# Machine Learning for Beginners - A Curriculum

> 🌍 Travel the world as we explore Machine Learning through the lens of global cultures 🌍  

Microsoft's Cloud Advocates are excited to present a 12-week, 26-lesson curriculum focused on **Machine Learning**. This curriculum introduces you to what is often referred to as **classic machine learning**, primarily using the Scikit-learn library and steering clear of deep learning, which is covered in our [AI for Beginners' curriculum](https://aka.ms/ai4beginners). Pair these lessons with our ['Data Science for Beginners' curriculum](https://aka.ms/ds4beginners) for a comprehensive learning experience!  

Join us on a journey around the globe as we apply these classic techniques to datasets from various regions. Each lesson includes pre- and post-lesson quizzes, step-by-step instructions, solutions, assignments, and more. Our project-based approach ensures that you learn by doing, a proven method for retaining new skills.  

**✍️ A big thank you to our authors** Jen Looper, Stephen Howell, Francesca Lazzeri, Tomomi Imura, Cassie Breviu, Dmitry Soshnikov, Chris Noring, Anirban Mukherjee, Ornella Altunyan, Ruth Yakubu, and Amy Boyd  

**🎨 Special thanks to our illustrators** Tomomi Imura, Dasani Madipalli, and Jen Looper  

**🙏 Heartfelt gratitude 🙏 to our Microsoft Student Ambassador authors, reviewers, and contributors**, including Rishit Dagli, Muhammad Sakib Khan Inan, Rohan Raj, Alexandru Petrescu, Abhishek Jaiswal, Nawrin Tabassum, Ioan Samuila, and Snigdha Agarwal  

**🤩 Extra appreciation to Microsoft Student Ambassadors Eric Wanjau, Jasleen Sondhi, and Vidushi Gupta for their contributions to our R lessons!**  

# Getting Started

Follow these steps:  
1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of this page.  
2. **Clone the Repository**:   `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners.git`  

> [Find additional resources for this course in our Microsoft Learn collection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/collections/qrqzamz1nn2wx3?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-bethanycheum)  

**[Students](https://aka.ms/student-page)**, to use this curriculum, fork the entire repository to your GitHub account and complete the exercises individually or in a group:  

- Start with a pre-lecture quiz.  
- Read the lecture and complete the activities, pausing to reflect during each knowledge check.  
- Try to build the projects by understanding the lessons rather than simply running the solution code. However, solution code is available in the `/solution` folders for each project-based lesson.  
- Take the post-lecture quiz.  
- Complete the challenge.  
- Finish the assignment.  
- After completing a lesson group, visit the [Discussion Board](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners/discussions) and "learn out loud" by filling out the appropriate PAT rubric. A 'PAT' is a Progress Assessment Tool that helps you reflect on your learning. You can also engage with other PATs to foster collaborative learning.  

> For further study, we recommend exploring these [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/jenlooper-2911/collections/k7o7tg1gp306q4?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-leestott) modules and learning paths.  

**Teachers**, we have [included some suggestions](for-teachers.md) on how to use this curriculum.

## Video walkthroughs

Some lessons are available as short-form videos. You can find these embedded in the lessons or on the [ML for Beginners playlist on the Microsoft Developer YouTube channel](https://aka.ms/ml-beginners-videos) by clicking the image below.

## Pedagogy

This curriculum is built on two key pedagogical principles: it is hands-on **project-based** and includes **frequent quizzes**. Additionally, the curriculum is tied together by a common **theme** for cohesion.  

By aligning the content with projects, the learning process becomes more engaging, and students are more likely to retain the concepts. Low-stakes quizzes before a lesson help set the stage for learning, while post-lesson quizzes reinforce understanding. This curriculum is designed to be flexible and enjoyable, allowing students to take it in full or in part. The projects start small and gradually increase in complexity over the 12-week period. A postscript on real-world ML applications is included, which can be used as extra credit or as a discussion starter.  

> Check out our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md), and [Translation](TRANSLATIONS.md) guidelines. We welcome your constructive feedback!  

## Each lesson includes

- Optional sketchnote  
- Optional supplemental video  
- Video walkthrough (for some lessons)  
- [Pre-lecture warmup quiz](https://ff-quizzes.netlify.app/en/ml/)  
- Written lesson  
- For project-based lessons, step-by-step guides to build the project  
- Knowledge checks  
- A challenge  
- Supplemental reading  
- Assignment  
- [Post-lecture quiz](https://ff-quizzes.netlify.app/en/ml/)  

> **A note about languages**: These lessons are primarily written in Python, but many are also available in R. To complete an R lesson, go to the `/solution` folder and look for R lessons. These files have an `.rmd` extension, which stands for **R Markdown**. R Markdown allows you to combine code, its output, and your thoughts in a single document. It can be rendered into formats like PDF, HTML, or Word.  

> **A note about quizzes**: All quizzes are located in the [Quiz App folder](../../quiz-app), with 52 quizzes in total, each containing three questions. Quizzes are linked within the lessons, but the quiz app can also be run locally. Follow the instructions in the `quiz-app` folder to host it locally or deploy it to Azure.
