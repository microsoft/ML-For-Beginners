# Search for a bot

## Instructions

Bots are everywhere. Your task: find one and interact with it! You can encounter them on websites, in banking apps, or even over the phoneâ€”for instance, when you contact financial services for advice or account details. Study the bot and see if you can confuse it. If you manage to confuse the bot, why do you think that happened? Write a brief paper describing your experience.
