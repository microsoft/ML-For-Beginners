## Instructions

In [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/jenlooper/emily-dickinson-word-frequency), you will find over 500 poems by Emily Dickinson that have been previously analyzed for sentiment using Azure text analytics. Using this dataset, apply the techniques discussed in the lesson to conduct your own analysis. Does the sentiment suggested by a poem align with the decision made by the more advanced Azure service? Why or why not, in your opinion? Did anything surprise you during the analysis?
