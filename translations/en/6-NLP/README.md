# Getting started with natural language processing

Natural language processing (NLP) is the ability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken and written—commonly referred to as natural language. It is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI). NLP has been around for over 50 years and has its origins in the field of linguistics. The entire field focuses on enabling machines to comprehend and process human language. This capability can then be applied to tasks such as spell checking or machine translation. NLP has numerous practical applications across various domains, including medical research, search engines, and business intelligence.

In this part of the curriculum, you'll explore one of the most prevalent applications of machine learning: natural language processing (NLP). Rooted in computational linguistics, this area of artificial intelligence serves as the connection between humans and machines through voice or text-based communication.

Throughout these lessons, we'll cover the fundamentals of NLP by creating small conversational bots to understand how machine learning enhances the intelligence of these interactions. You'll take a journey back in time, engaging in conversations with Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy from Jane Austen's timeless novel, **Pride and Prejudice**, published in 1813. Afterward, you'll deepen your understanding by exploring sentiment analysis using hotel reviews from Europe.
