# Make a Bot talk back

## Instructions

In the previous lessons, you programmed a basic bot to chat with. This bot gives random responses until you say 'bye'. Can you make the responses a bit less random and trigger specific answers when you say certain things, like 'why' or 'how'? Think about how machine learning could make this process less manual as you enhance your bot. You can use libraries like NLTK or TextBlob to simplify your tasks.
