Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.  

  a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:  

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or  

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.  

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.  

  d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.  

  e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.  


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.  

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.  

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated in this Public License are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.  


Section 8 -- Interpretation.  

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.  

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.  

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.  

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation or waiver of any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.  
Rights, then the database in which you hold Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is considered Adapted Material,

including for the purposes of Section 3(b); and  
c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if you share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For clarity, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
