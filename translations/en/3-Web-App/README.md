# Build a web app to use your ML model

In this part of the curriculum, you'll explore a practical application of machine learning: how to save your Scikit-learn model as a file that can be used to make predictions in a web application. Once the model is saved, you'll learn how to integrate it into a web app built with Flask. You'll start by creating a model using data about UFO sightings! Then, you'll develop a web app that allows users to input a number of seconds along with latitude and longitude values to predict which country reported the UFO sighting.
