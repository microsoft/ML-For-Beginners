    "\n",
    "In these four lessons, you'll dive into one of the core areas of classic machine learning: *classification*. We'll explore various classification algorithms using a dataset about the diverse and delicious cuisines of Asia and India. Get ready to whet your appetite!\n",

    "\n",
    "Classification is a type of [supervised learning](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) that shares many similarities with regression techniques. In classification, you train a model to predict which `category` an item belongs to. If machine learning is about predicting values or assigning names to things using datasets, classification typically falls into two categories: *binary classification* and *multiclass classification*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Linear regression** helped you predict relationships between variables and make accurate predictions about where a new data point would fall in relation to that line. For example, you could predict numeric values like *the price of a pumpkin in September versus December*.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Logistic regression** helped you identify \"binary categories\": at a certain price point, *is this pumpkin orange or not-orange*?\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification uses various algorithms to determine other ways of assigning a label or class to a data point. In this lesson, we'll use cuisine data to see if we can predict the cuisine of origin based on a set of ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [**Pre-lecture quiz**](https://gray-sand-07a10f403.1.azurestaticapps.net/quiz/19/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is a fundamental task for machine learning researchers and data scientists. From simple binary classification (\"is this email spam or not?\") to complex image classification and segmentation using computer vision, the ability to sort data into classes and analyze it is invaluable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it in more scientific terms, classification involves creating a predictive model that maps the relationship between input variables and output variables.\n",
    "\n",

    "   width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "   <figcaption>Binary vs. multiclass problems for classification algorithms to handle. Infographic by Jen Looper</figcaption>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into cleaning, visualizing, and preparing our data for machine learning tasks, let's explore the different ways machine learning can be used to classify data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Derived from [statistics](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification), classification in classic machine learning uses features like `smoker`, `weight`, and `age` to predict *the likelihood of developing a certain disease*. As a supervised learning technique similar to the regression exercises you've done before, classification uses labeled data and machine learning algorithms to predict and assign classes (or 'features') of a dataset to specific groups or outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Take a moment to imagine a dataset about cuisines. What kinds of questions could a multiclass model answer? What about a binary model? For instance, could you predict whether a given cuisine is likely to use fenugreek? Or, if you were handed a grocery bag containing star anise, artichokes, cauliflower, and horseradish, could you determine whether you could create a typical Indian dish?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Hello 'classifier'**\n",
    "\n",
    "The question we want to answer with this cuisine dataset is a **multiclass question**, as we have several possible national cuisines to consider. Based on a set of ingredients, which of these many classes does the data belong to?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tidymodels provides several algorithms for classifying data, depending on the type of problem you're trying to solve. In the next two lessons, you'll learn about some of these algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Prerequisite**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lesson, we'll need the following packages to clean, prepare, and visualize our data:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `tidyverse`: The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a [collection of R packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages) designed to make data science faster, easier, and more enjoyable.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `tidymodels`: The [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) framework is a [collection of packages](https://www.tidymodels.org/packages/) for modeling and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `DataExplorer`: The [DataExplorer package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DataExplorer/vignettes/dataexplorer-intro.html) simplifies and automates the exploratory data analysis (EDA) process and report generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `themis`: The [themis package](https://themis.tidymodels.org/) provides additional recipe steps for handling unbalanced data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install them using:\n",
    "\n",
    "`install.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"tidymodels\", \"DataExplorer\", \"here\"))`\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the script below checks whether the required packages for this module are installed and installs them for you if they're missing.\n"

Imbalanced data often negatively impacts model performance. Consider a binary classification scenario: if most of your data belongs to one class, a machine learning model will tend to predict that class more frequently simply because there is more data available for it. Balancing the data addresses any skewed distribution and helps eliminate this imbalance. Many models perform best when the number of observations is equal, and they often struggle with unbalanced data.\n",
