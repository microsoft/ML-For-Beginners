# Explore classification methods

## Instructions

In [Scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html), you'll find an extensive list of ways to classify data. Take some time to explore these docs: your goal is to identify classification methods and connect them to a dataset from this curriculum, a question you can pose about it, and a classification technique. Create a spreadsheet or table in a .doc file and describe how the dataset would interact with the classification algorithm.
