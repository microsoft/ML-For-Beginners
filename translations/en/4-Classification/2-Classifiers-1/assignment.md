# Study the solvers
## Instructions

In this lesson, you learned about the different solvers that combine algorithms with a machine learning process to build an accurate model. Review the solvers mentioned in the lesson and choose two. In your own words, compare and contrast these two solvers. What type of problem do they solve? How do they interact with different data structures? Why would you choose one over the other?
