# A ML Scavenger Hunt

## Instructions

In this lesson, you learned about various real-world applications that were addressed using classical machine learning. While advancements in deep learning, new AI techniques and tools, and the use of neural networks have accelerated the development of solutions in these areas, classical machine learning techniques covered in this curriculum remain highly valuable.

For this assignment, imagine you are participating in a hackathon. Use the knowledge gained from the curriculum to propose a solution using classical machine learning to tackle a problem in one of the sectors discussed in this lesson. Prepare a presentation explaining how you plan to implement your idea. Bonus points if you can collect sample data and build a machine learning model to support your concept!
