# A new ARIMA model

## Instructions

Now that you have built an ARIMA model, create a new one using fresh data (try one of [these datasets from Duke](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mw/ts_data_sets.html)). Document your work in a notebook, visualize the data and your model, and evaluate its accuracy using MAPE.
