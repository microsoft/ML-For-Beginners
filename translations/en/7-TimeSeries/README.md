# Introduction to time series forecasting

What is time series forecasting? It's the process of predicting future events by analyzing past trends.

## Regional topic: worldwide electricity usage ✨

In these two lessons, you will explore time series forecasting, a relatively lesser-known area of machine learning that is highly valuable for applications in industry, business, and other fields. While neural networks can enhance the effectiveness of these models, we will focus on classical machine learning approaches to predict future outcomes based on historical data.

Our regional focus is on global electricity usage, an intriguing dataset that helps us learn how to forecast future power consumption by analyzing past load patterns. This type of forecasting can be incredibly useful in a business context.
