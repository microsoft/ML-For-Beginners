# A new SVR model

## Instructions [^1]

Now that you have created an SVR model, build a new one using fresh data (consider one of [these datasets from Duke](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mw/ts_data_sets.html)). Document your work in a notebook, visualize the data and your model, and evaluate its accuracy using appropriate plots and MAPE. Additionally, experiment with adjusting various hyperparameters and try different values for the timesteps.

## Rubric [^1]

| Criteria | Outstanding                                                  | Satisfactory                                              | Needs Improvement                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
|          | A notebook is provided with an SVR model that is built, tested, and explained, including visualizations and stated accuracy. | The notebook provided lacks annotations or contains errors. | An incomplete notebook is submitted |
