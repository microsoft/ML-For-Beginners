# Visualize some more Time Series

## Instructions

You've started learning about Time Series Forecasting by exploring the type of data that requires this specialized modeling. You've visualized some data related to energy. Now, search for other datasets that could benefit from Time Series Forecasting. Find three examples (consider [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) and [Azure Open Datasets](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/open-datasets/catalog/?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-leestott)) and create a notebook to visualize them. Make notes in the notebook about any unique characteristics they exhibit (seasonality, sudden changes, or other trends).
