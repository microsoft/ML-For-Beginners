# Regression with Scikit-learn

## Instructions

Explore the [Linnerud dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_linnerud.html#sklearn.datasets.load_linnerud) available in Scikit-learn. This dataset includes multiple [targets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#linnerrud-dataset): 'It contains three exercise (data) and three physiological (target) variables collected from twenty middle-aged men at a fitness club.'

In your own words, explain how to build a Regression model that visualizes the relationship between waist circumference and the number of sit-ups performed. Repeat this process for the other data points in the dataset.
