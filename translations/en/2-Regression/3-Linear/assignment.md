# Create a Regression Model

## Instructions

In this lesson, you learned how to create a model using both Linear and Polynomial Regression. Using this knowledge, find a dataset or use one of Scikit-learn's built-in datasets to develop a new model. In your notebook, explain why you chose the specific technique and demonstrate the accuracy of your model. If the model is not accurate, provide an explanation for the result.
