    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point, you’ve explored what regression is using sample data from the pumpkin pricing dataset that we’ll be working with throughout this lesson. You’ve also visualized the data using `ggplot2`. 💪\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you’re ready to dive deeper into regression for machine learning. In this lesson, you’ll learn more about two types of regression: *basic linear regression* and *polynomial regression*, along with some of the mathematics behind these techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Throughout this curriculum, we assume minimal math knowledge and aim to make the content accessible to students from various fields. Look out for notes, 🧮 math callouts, diagrams, and other learning tools to help with understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, you’re working with this data to answer specific questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   When is the best time to buy pumpkins?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   What price can I expect for a case of miniature pumpkins?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Should I buy them in half-bushel baskets or in 1 1/9 bushel boxes? Let’s keep exploring this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson, you created a `tibble` (a modern reimagining of the data frame) and filled it with part of the original dataset, standardizing the pricing by the bushel. However, by doing so, you were only able to gather about 400 data points, and only for the fall months. Could we uncover more details about the data by cleaning it further? Let’s find out... 🕵️‍♀️\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, we’ll need the following packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `tidyverse`: The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a [collection of R packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages) designed to make data science faster, easier, and more enjoyable!\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `tidymodels`: The [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) framework is a [collection of packages](https://www.tidymodels.org/packages/) for modeling and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `janitor`: The [janitor package](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor) provides simple tools for examining and cleaning messy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `corrplot`: The [corrplot package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/vignettes/corrplot-intro.html) offers a visual exploratory tool for correlation matrices, with automatic variable reordering to help detect hidden patterns among variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install them using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`install.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"tidymodels\", \"janitor\", \"corrplot\"))`\n",
    "\n",
    "The script below checks whether you have the required packages for this module and installs them for you if they’re missing.\n"

    "\n",
    "## 1. A linear regression line\n",
    "\n",
    "As you learned in Lesson 1, the goal of a linear regression exercise is to plot a *line of best fit* to:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Show variable relationships**. Illustrate the relationship between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Make predictions**. Accurately predict where a new data point might fall in relation to that line.\n",
    "\n",
    "To draw this type of line, we use a statistical technique called **Least-Squares Regression**. The term `least-squares` means that all the data points surrounding the regression line are squared and then summed. Ideally, this final sum is as small as possible, because we want a low number of errors, or `least-squares`. Therefore, the line of best fit is the line that minimizes the sum of the squared errors—hence the name *least squares regression*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this because we want to model a line that has the smallest cumulative distance from all of our data points. The terms are squared before summing because we care about the magnitude of the errors, not their direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **🧮 Show me the math**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This line, called the *line of best fit*, can be expressed by [an equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression):\n",
    ">\n",
    ">     Y = a + bX\n",
    ">\n",
    "> `X` is the '`explanatory variable` or `predictor`'. `Y` is the '`dependent variable` or `outcome`'. The slope of the line is `b`, and `a` is the y-intercept, which represents the value of `Y` when `X = 0`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    "> ![](../../../../../../2-Regression/3-Linear/solution/images/slope.png \"slope = $y/x$\")\n",
    "    Infographic by Jen Looper\n",
    ">\n",
    "> First, calculate the slope `b`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In other words, referring to our pumpkin data's original question: \"predict the price of a pumpkin per bushel by month,\" `X` would represent the price, and `Y` would represent the month of sale.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ![](../../../../../../translated_images/calculation.989aa7822020d9d0ba9fc781f1ab5192f3421be86ebb88026528aef33c37b0d8.en.png)\n",
    "    Infographic by Jen Looper\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Calculate the value of Y. If you're paying around \\$4, it must be April!\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The math used to calculate the line must account for the slope of the line, which also depends on the intercept, or where `Y` is positioned when `X = 0`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You can see the method for calculating these values on the [Math is Fun](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/least-squares-regression.html) website. Also, check out [this Least-Squares Calculator](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/least-squares-calculator.html) to see how the values affect the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not so intimidating, right? 🤓\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important term to understand is the **Correlation Coefficient** between the given X and Y variables. Using a scatterplot, you can quickly visualize this coefficient. A plot where the data points form a neat line has high correlation, while a plot where the data points are scattered randomly between X and Y has low correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good linear regression model will have a high Correlation Coefficient (closer to 1 than 0) when using the Least-Squares Regression method with a line of regression.\n"
