The lessons in this section focus on types of regression within the context of machine learning. Regression models are useful for identifying the _relationship_ between variables. These models can predict values like length, temperature, or age, helping to uncover patterns and relationships as they analyze data points.

In this series of lessons, you'll learn the differences between linear and logistic regression, and understand when to use one over the other.

In this set of lessons, you'll prepare to start machine learning tasks, including setting up Visual Studio Code to manage notebooks, a common environment for data scientists. You'll explore Scikit-learn, a machine learning library, and build your first models, focusing on regression models in this chapter.

The pumpkin dataset is recommended by [this project on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/usda/a-year-of-pumpkin-prices) and its data is sourced from the [Specialty Crops Terminal Markets Standard Reports](https://www.marketnews.usda.gov/mnp/fv-report-config-step1?type=termPrice) provided by the United States Department of Agriculture. We have added some points related to color based on variety to normalize the distribution. This data is in the public domain.
