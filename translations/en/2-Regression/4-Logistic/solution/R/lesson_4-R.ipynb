    "\n",
    "In this final lesson on Regression, one of the fundamental *classic* ML techniques, we will explore Logistic Regression. This method is used to identify patterns for predicting binary categories. For example: Is this candy chocolate or not? Is this disease contagious or not? Will this customer choose this product or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Techniques for logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… Enhance your understanding of this type of regression by exploring this [Learn module](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/introduction-classification-models/?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-leestott)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisite\n",
    "\n",
    "After working with the pumpkin data, we are now familiar enough with it to identify a binary category we can work with: `Color`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a logistic regression model to predict, based on certain variables, *what color a given pumpkin is likely to be* (orange ðŸŽƒ or white ðŸ‘»).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why are we discussing binary classification in a lesson series about regression? It's mainly for linguistic convenience, as logistic regression is [actually a classification method](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#logistic-regression), though it is based on linear principles. Youâ€™ll learn about other classification methods in the next lesson series.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lesson, we'll need the following packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `tidyverse`: The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a [collection of R packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages) designed to make data science faster, easier, and more enjoyable!\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `tidymodels`: The [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) framework is a [collection of packages](https://www.tidymodels.org/packages/) for modeling and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `janitor`: The [janitor package](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor) offers simple tools for examining and cleaning messy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `ggbeeswarm`: The [ggbeeswarm package](https://github.com/eclarke/ggbeeswarm) provides methods for creating beeswarm-style plots using ggplot2.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install them using:\n",
    "\n",
    "`install.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"tidymodels\", \"janitor\", \"ggbeeswarm\"))`\n",

    "\n",
    "Logistic regression doesn't provide the same functionality as linear regression.

    "### Other classifications\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Multinomial**, which deals with more than two categories - \"Orange, White, and Striped.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "#### **Variables DO NOT have to correlate**\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember how linear regression worked better with highly correlated variables? Logistic regression is differentâ€”it doesn't require the variables to be strongly correlated. This is helpful for our dataset, which has relatively weak correlations.\n",

    "### Data pre-processing: feature encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Our pumpkins dataset contains string values for all its columns. While humans find it intuitive to work with categorical data, machines do not. Machine learning algorithms perform better with numerical data. This makes encoding a crucial step in the data pre-processing phase, as it allows us to convert categorical data into numerical data without losing any information. Effective encoding contributes to building a strong model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of encoders for feature encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ordinal encoder**: This is suitable for ordinal variables, which are categorical variables with a logical order, like the `item_size` column in our dataset. It creates a mapping where each category is represented by a number corresponding to its order in the column.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Categorical encoder**: This is suitable for nominal variables, which are categorical variables without a logical order, like all the features other than `item_size` in our dataset. It uses one-hot encoding, meaning each category is represented by a binary column: the encoded variable equals 1 if the pumpkin belongs to that variety and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tidymodels offers another useful package: [recipes](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/)â€”a package for data preprocessing. We'll define a `recipe` to specify that all predictor columns should be encoded into a set of integers, `prep` it to estimate the necessary quantities and statistics for any operations, and finally `bake` it to apply the computations to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Typically, recipes are used as preprocessors for modeling, where they define the steps to be applied to a dataset to prepare it for modeling. In such cases, it is **highly recommended** to use a `workflow()` instead of manually estimating a recipe using prep and bake. We'll explore this shortly.\n",

    "One commonly used metric for classification problems is the [`confusion matrix`](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix). A confusion matrix provides a summary of how well a classification model performs. It shows how many examples in each class were correctly classified by the model. In our case, it will indicate how many orange pumpkins were correctly identified as orange and how many white pumpkins were correctly identified as white. Additionally, the confusion matrix highlights how many examples were misclassified into the **wrong** categories.\n",

Typically, ROC curves display `True Positive Rate`/Sensitivity on the Y-axis and `False Positive Rate`/1-Specificity on the X-axis. Therefore, the steepness of the curve and the distance between the diagonal line and the curve are important: you want a curve that rises sharply and moves away from the diagonal. In our case, there are some false positives at the beginning, but the curve eventually rises and moves away as expected.\n",
