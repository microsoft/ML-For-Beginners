# Try different clustering methods

## Instructions

In this lesson, you learned about K-Means clustering. However, K-Means might not always be the best fit for your data. Create a notebook using data either from these lessons or from another source (make sure to credit your source) and demonstrate a different clustering method that does NOT use K-Means. What insights did you gain?
