# Clustering models for machine learning

Clustering is a machine learning task that aims to identify objects that are similar to each other and group them into clusters. What sets clustering apart from other machine learning approaches is that it happens automatically. In fact, itâ€™s fair to say itâ€™s the opposite of supervised learning.

## Regional topic: clustering models for a Nigerian audience's musical taste ðŸŽ§

Nigeriaâ€™s diverse population has equally diverse musical preferences. Using data scraped from Spotify (inspired by [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/country-wise-visual-analysis-of-music-taste-using-spotify-api-seaborn-in-python-77f5b749b421)), letâ€™s explore some music thatâ€™s popular in Nigeria. This dataset includes information about various songs, such as their 'danceability' score, 'acousticness', loudness, 'speechiness', popularity, and energy. It will be fascinating to uncover patterns in this data!

In this series of lessons, youâ€™ll learn new ways to analyze data using clustering techniques. Clustering is especially useful when your dataset doesnâ€™t have labels. If your dataset does have labels, classification techniques like the ones you learned in earlier lessons might be more appropriate. However, when you want to group unlabeled data, clustering is an excellent way to uncover patterns.

> There are helpful low-code tools available to assist you in working with clustering models. Consider using [Azure ML for this task](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/create-clustering-model-azure-machine-learning-designer/?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-leestott).
