# Study di solvers
## Instructions

For dis lesson, you don learn about di diffren solvers wey dey pair algorithms wit machine learning process to fit create correct model. Go through di solvers wey dem list for di lesson and choose two. For your own words, compare and contrast di two solvers. Wetin kind problem dem dey solve? How dem dey work wit diffren data structures? Why you go choose one instead of di other one? 

## Rubric

| Criteria | Exemplary                                                                                      | Adequate                                         | Needs Improvement            |
