# Clustering Models for Machine Learning

Clustering na machine learning task wey dey try find objects wey resemble each oda and group dem into groups wey dem dey call clusters. Wetin make clustering different from oda methods for machine learning be say e dey happen automatically. In fact, you fit talk say e be opposite of supervised learning.

## Regional Topic: Clustering Models for Nigerian People Music Taste 🎧

Nigeria get plenty different people and dem music taste dey different too. Using data wey dem collect from Spotify (inspired by [dis article](https://towardsdatascience.com/country-wise-visual-analysis-of-music-taste-using-spotify-api-seaborn-in-python-77f5b749b421)), make we check some music wey dey popular for Nigeria. Dis dataset get data about different songs like 'danceability' score, 'acousticness', loudness, 'speechiness', popularity, and energy. E go dey interesting to see wetin we fit discover for dis data!

For dis series of lessons, you go learn new ways to analyze data using clustering techniques. Clustering dey very useful when your dataset no get labels. If e get labels, classification techniques like the ones wey you don learn for previous lessons go make more sense. But if you wan group data wey no get labels, clustering na better way to find patterns.

> Some low-code tools dey wey fit help you learn how to work with clustering models. Try [Azure ML for dis task](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/create-clustering-model-azure-machine-learning-designer/?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-leestott)
