Di lessons for dis section go talk about di different types of regression for machine learning. Regression models fit help us sabi di _relationship_ wey dey between variables. Dis kind model fit predict values like length, temperature, or age, and e go help us see di relationship wey dey between di variables as e dey analyze di data.

For dis series of lessons, you go sabi di difference wey dey between linear regression and logistic regression, and you go sabi di time wey you go use one instead of di other.

> 🎥 Click di image wey dey up for short video wey dey introduce regression models.

For dis group of lessons, you go learn how to start machine learning tasks, including how to set up Visual Studio Code to manage notebooks, wey be di common environment for data scientists. You go sabi Scikit-learn, one library for machine learning, and you go build your first models, wey go focus on Regression models for dis chapter.

> E get some low-code tools wey fit help you learn how to work with regression models. Try [Azure ML for dis task](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/create-regression-model-azure-machine-learning-designer/?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-leestott)
