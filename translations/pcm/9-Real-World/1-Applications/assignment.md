# ML Scavenger Hunt

## Instructions

For dis lesson, you don learn about many real-life example wey dem solve wit classical ML. Even though deep learning, new techniques and tools for AI, and using neural networks don help make tools for dis sectors faster, classical ML wey use di techniques for dis curriculum still get plenty value.

For dis assignment, imagine say you dey participate for one hackathon. Use wetin you don learn for di curriculum to suggest one solution wey go use classical ML solve one problem for one of di sectors wey dem talk about for dis lesson. Create one presentation wey go explain how you go take implement your idea. You go get extra points if you fit gather sample data and build one ML model to support your concept!
