# Introduction to time series forecasting

Wetin be time series forecasting? Na di way wey dem dey predict wetin go happen for future by check di trend wey don happen for past.

## Regional topic: worldwide electricity usage ✨

For dis two lessons, you go sabi wetin time series forecasting be, one area for machine learning wey no too popular but e still dey very useful for industry and business work, plus other areas. Even though neural networks fit help make dis models better, we go study am for di classical machine learning way, as di models dey help predict wetin go happen for future based on wetin don happen for past.

Di regional focus na di electricity usage for di world, one kind dataset wey dey interesting to take learn how to forecast di power wey people go use for future based on di pattern of di load wey dem don use before. You go see as dis kind forecasting fit dey very useful for business work.
