## For Educators

You wan use dis curriculum for your classroom? Abeg feel free!

In fact, you fit use am inside GitHub sef by using GitHub Classroom.

To do am, fork dis repo. You go need create repo for each lesson, so you go need carry each folder put for separate repo. Like dat, [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms) go fit pick each lesson one by one.

Dis [full instructions](https://github.blog/2020-03-18-set-up-your-digital-classroom-with-github-classroom/) go show you how you fit set up your classroom.

## Using the repo as e dey

If you wan use dis repo as e dey now, without GitHub Classroom, you fit do am too. You go need tell your students which lesson una go work on together.

For online format (Zoom, Teams, or any other one), you fit create breakout rooms for the quizzes, and mentor students to help dem prepare to learn. Then you fit invite students for the quizzes and make dem submit their answers as 'issues' for one particular time. You fit do the same thing for assignments, if you wan make students work together openly.

If you prefer private format, tell your students make dem fork the curriculum, lesson by lesson, to their own GitHub repos as private repos, and give you access. Then dem fit complete quizzes and assignments privately and submit am to you through issues for your classroom repo.

Plenty ways dey to make dis thing work for online classroom format. Abeg let us know which one work best for you!
