# Cuisine classifiers 1

In this lesson, you will use the dataset you saved from the last lesson full of balanced, clean data all about cuisines.

You will use this dataset with a variety of classifiers to _predict a given national cuisine based on a group of ingredients_. While doing so, you'll learn more about some of the ways that algorithms can be leveraged for classification tasks.

## [Pre-lecture quiz](https://ff-quizzes.netlify.app/en/ml/)
# Preparation

Assuming you completed [Lesson 1](../1-Introduction/README.md), make sure that a _cleaned_cuisines.csv_ file exists in the root `/data` folder for these four lessons.

## Exercise - predict a national cuisine

1. Working in this lesson's _notebook.ipynb_ folder, import that file along with the Pandas library:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    cuisines_df = pd.read_csv("../data/cleaned_cuisines.csv")
    cuisines_df.head()
    ```

    The data looks like this:

|     | Unnamed: 0 | cuisine | almond | angelica | anise | anise_seed | apple | apple_brandy | apricot | armagnac | ... | whiskey | white_bread | white_wine | whole_grain_wheat_flour | wine | wood | yam | yeast | yogurt | zucchini |
| --- | ---------- | ------- | ------ | -------- | ----- | ---------- | ----- | ------------ | ------- | -------- | --- | ------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------------- | ---- | ---- | --- | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| 0   | 0          | indian  | 0      | 0        | 0     | 0          | 0     | 0            | 0       | 0        | ... | 0       | 0           | 0          | 0                       | 0    | 0    | 0   | 0     | 0      | 0        |
| 1   | 1          | indian  | 1      | 0        | 0     | 0          | 0     | 0            | 0       | 0        | ... | 0       | 0           | 0          | 0                       | 0    | 0    | 0   | 0     | 0      | 0        |
| 2   | 2          | indian  | 0      | 0        | 0     | 0          | 0     | 0            | 0       | 0        | ... | 0       | 0           | 0          | 0                       | 0    | 0    | 0   | 0     | 0      | 0        |
| 3   | 3          | indian  | 0      | 0        | 0     | 0          | 0     | 0            | 0       | 0        | ... | 0       | 0           | 0          | 0                       | 0    | 0    | 0   | 0     | 0      | 0        |
| 4   | 4          | indian  | 0      | 0        | 0     | 0          | 0     | 0            | 0       | 0        | ... | 0       | 0           | 0          | 0                       | 0    | 0    | 0   | 0     | 1      | 0        |
  

1. Now, import several more libraries:

    ```python
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score,precision_score,confusion_matrix,classification_report, precision_recall_curve
    from sklearn.svm import SVC
    import numpy as np
    ```

1. Divide the X and y coordinates into two dataframes for training. `cuisine` can be the labels dataframe:

    ```python
    cuisines_label_df = cuisines_df['cuisine']
    cuisines_label_df.head()
    ```

    It will look like this:

    ```output
    0    indian
    1    indian
    2    indian
    3    indian
    4    indian
    Name: cuisine, dtype: object
    ```

1. Drop that `Unnamed: 0` column and the `cuisine` column, calling `drop()`. Save the rest of the data as trainable features:

    ```python
    cuisines_feature_df = cuisines_df.drop(['Unnamed: 0', 'cuisine'], axis=1)
    cuisines_feature_df.head()
    ```

    Your features look like this:

|      | almond | angelica | anise | anise_seed | apple | apple_brandy | apricot | armagnac | artemisia | artichoke |  ... | whiskey | white_bread | white_wine | whole_grain_wheat_flour | wine | wood |  yam | yeast | yogurt | zucchini |
| ---: | -----: | -------: | ----: | ---------: | ----: | -----------: | ------: | -------: | --------: | --------: | ---: | ------: | ----------: | ---------: | ----------------------: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ----: | -----: | -------: |
|    0 |      0 |        0 |     0 |          0 |     0 |            0 |       0 |        0 |         0 |         0 |  ... |       0 |           0 |          0 |                       0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |     0 |      0 |        0 | 0 |
|    1 |      1 |        0 |     0 |          0 |     0 |            0 |       0 |        0 |         0 |         0 |  ... |       0 |           0 |          0 |                       0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |     0 |      0 |        0 | 0 |
|    2 |      0 |        0 |     0 |          0 |     0 |            0 |       0 |        0 |         0 |         0 |  ... |       0 |           0 |          0 |                       0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |     0 |      0 |        0 | 0 |
|    3 |      0 |        0 |     0 |          0 |     0 |            0 |       0 |        0 |         0 |         0 |  ... |       0 |           0 |          0 |                       0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |     0 |      0 |        0 | 0 |
|    4 |      0 |        0 |     0 |          0 |     0 |            0 |       0 |        0 |         0 |         0 |  ... |       0 |           0 |          0 |                       0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |     0 |      1 |        0 | 0 |

Now you are ready to train your model!

## Choosing your classifier

Now that your data is clean and ready for training, you have to decide which algorithm to use for the job. 

Scikit-learn groups classification under Supervised Learning, and in that category you will find many ways to classify. [The variety](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) is quite bewildering at first sight. The following methods all include classification techniques:

- Linear Models
- Support Vector Machines
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Nearest Neighbors
- Gaussian Processes
- Decision Trees
- Ensemble methods (voting Classifier)
- Multiclass and multioutput algorithms (multiclass and multilabel classification, multiclass-multioutput classification)

> You can also use [neural networks to classify data](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neural_networks_supervised.html#classification), but that is outside the scope of this lesson.

### What classifier to go with?

So, which classifier should you choose? Often, running through several and looking for a good result is a way to test. Scikit-learn offers a [side-by-side comparison](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html) on a created dataset, comparing KNeighbors, SVC two ways, GaussianProcessClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, MLPClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, GaussianNB and QuadraticDiscrinationAnalysis, showing the results visualized: 

![comparison of classifiers](images/comparison.png)
> Plots generated on Scikit-learn's documentation

> AutoML solves this problem neatly by running these comparisons in the cloud, allowing you to choose the best algorithm for your data. Try it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/automate-model-selection-with-azure-automl/?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-leestott)

### A better approach

A better way than wildly guessing, however, is to follow the ideas on this downloadable [ML Cheat sheet](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/algorithm-cheat-sheet?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-leestott). Here, we discover that, for our multiclass problem, we have some choices:

![cheatsheet for multiclass problems](images/cheatsheet.png)
> A section of Microsoft's Algorithm Cheat Sheet, detailing multiclass classification options

âœ… Download this cheat sheet, print it out, and hang it on your wall!

### Reasoning

Let's see if we can reason our way through different approaches given the constraints we have:

- **Neural networks are too heavy**. Given our clean, but minimal dataset, and the fact that we are running training locally via notebooks, neural networks are too heavyweight for this task.
- **No two-class classifier**. We do not use a two-class classifier, so that rules out one-vs-all. 
- **Decision tree or logistic regression could work**. A decision tree might work, or logistic regression for multiclass data. 
- **Multiclass Boosted Decision Trees solve a different problem**. The multiclass boosted decision tree is most suitable for nonparametric tasks, e.g. tasks designed to build rankings, so it is not useful for us.

### Using Scikit-learn 

We will be using Scikit-learn to analyze our data. However, there are many ways to use logistic regression in Scikit-learn. Take a look at the [parameters to pass](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html?highlight=logistic%20regressio#sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression).  

Essentially there are two important parameters - `multi_class` and `solver` - that we need to specify, when we ask Scikit-learn to perform a logistic regression. The `multi_class` value applies a certain behavior. The value of the solver is what algorithm to use. Not all solvers can be paired with all `multi_class` values.

According to the docs, in the multiclass case, the training algorithm:

- **Uses the one-vs-rest (OvR) scheme**, if the `multi_class` option is set to `ovr`
- **Uses the cross-entropy loss**, if the `multi_class` option is set to `multinomial`. (Currently the `multinomial` option is supported only by the â€˜lbfgsâ€™, â€˜sagâ€™, â€˜sagaâ€™ and â€˜newton-cgâ€™ solvers.)"

> ðŸŽ“ The 'scheme' here can either be 'ovr' (one-vs-rest) or 'multinomial'. Since logistic regression is really designed to support binary classification, these schemes allow it to better handle multiclass classification tasks. [source](https://machinelearningmastery.com/one-vs-rest-and-one-vs-one-for-multi-class-classification/)

> ðŸŽ“ The 'solver' is defined as "the algorithm to use in the optimization problem". [source](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html?highlight=logistic%20regressio#sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression).

Scikit-learn offers this table to explain how solvers handle different challenges presented by different kinds of data structures:

![solvers](images/solvers.png)

## Exercise - split the data

We can focus on logistic regression for our first training trial since you recently learned about the latter in a previous lesson.
Split your data into training and testing groups by calling `train_test_split()`:

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(cuisines_feature_df, cuisines_label_df, test_size=0.3)
```

## Exercise - apply logistic regression

Since you are using the multiclass case, you need to choose what _scheme_ to use and what _solver_ to set. Use LogisticRegression with a multiclass setting and the **liblinear** solver to train.

1. Create a logistic regression with multi_class set to `ovr` and the solver set to `liblinear`:

    ```python
    lr = LogisticRegression(multi_class='ovr',solver='liblinear')
    model = lr.fit(X_train, np.ravel(y_train))
    
    accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
    print ("Accuracy is {}".format(accuracy))
    ```

    âœ… Try a different solver like `lbfgs`, which is often set as default

    > Note, use Pandas [`ravel`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.ravel.html) function to flatten your data when needed.

    The accuracy is good at over **80%**!

1. You can see this model in action by testing one row of data (#50):

    ```python
    print(f'ingredients: {X_test.iloc[50][X_test.iloc[50]!=0].keys()}')
    print(f'cuisine: {y_test.iloc[50]}')
    ```

    The result is printed:

   ```output
   ingredients: Index(['cilantro', 'onion', 'pea', 'potato', 'tomato', 'vegetable_oil'], dtype='object')
   cuisine: indian
   ```

   âœ… Try a different row number and check the results

1. Digging deeper, you can check for the accuracy of this prediction:

    ```python
    test= X_test.iloc[50].values.reshape(-1, 1).T
    proba = model.predict_proba(test)
    classes = model.classes_
    resultdf = pd.DataFrame(data=proba, columns=classes)
    
    topPrediction = resultdf.T.sort_values(by=[0], ascending = [False])
    topPrediction.head()
    ```

    The result is printed - Indian cuisine is its best guess, with good probability:

    |          |        0 |
    | -------: | -------: |
    |   indian | 0.715851 |
    |  chinese | 0.229475 |
    | japanese | 0.029763 |
    |   korean | 0.017277 |
    |     thai | 0.007634 |

    âœ… Can you explain why the model is pretty sure this is an Indian cuisine?

1. Get more detail by printing a classification report, as you did in the regression lessons:

    ```python
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    print(classification_report(y_test,y_pred))
    ```

    |              | precision | recall | f1-score | support |
    | ------------ | --------- | ------ | -------- | ------- |
    | chinese      | 0.73      | 0.71   | 0.72     | 229     |
    | indian       | 0.91      | 0.93   | 0.92     | 254     |
    | japanese     | 0.70      | 0.75   | 0.72     | 220     |
    | korean       | 0.86      | 0.76   | 0.81     | 242     |
    | thai         | 0.79      | 0.85   | 0.82     | 254     |
    | accuracy     | 0.80      | 1199   |          |         |
    | macro avg    | 0.80      | 0.80   | 0.80     | 1199    |
    | weighted avg | 0.80      | 0.80   | 0.80     | 1199    |

## ðŸš€Challenge

In this lesson, you used your cleaned data to build a machine learning model that can predict a national cuisine based on a series of ingredients. Take some time to read through the many options Scikit-learn provides to classify data. Dig deeper into the concept of 'solver' to understand what goes on behind the scenes.
