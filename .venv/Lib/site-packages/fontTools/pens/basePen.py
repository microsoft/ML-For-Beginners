"""fontTools.pens.basePen.py -- Tools and base classes to build pen objects.

The Pen Protocol

A Pen is a kind of object that standardizes the way how to "draw" outlines:
it is a middle man between an outline and a drawing. In other words:
it is an abstraction for drawing outlines, making sure that outline objects
don't need to know the details about how and where they're being drawn, and
that drawings don't need to know the details of how outlines are stored.

The most basic pattern is this::

	outline.draw(pen)  # 'outline' draws itself onto 'pen'

Pens can be used to render outlines to the screen, but also to construct
new outlines. Eg. an outline object can be both a drawable object (it has a
draw() method) as well as a pen itself: you *build* an outline using pen
methods.

The AbstractPen class defines the Pen protocol. It implements almost
nothing (only no-op closePath() and endPath() methods), but is useful
for documentation purposes. Subclassing it basically tells the reader:
"this class implements the Pen protocol.". An examples of an AbstractPen
subclass is :py:class:`fontTools.pens.transformPen.TransformPen`.

The BasePen class is a base implementation useful for pens that actually
draw (for example a pen renders outlines using a native graphics engine).
BasePen contains a lot of base functionality, making it very easy to build
a pen that fully conforms to the pen protocol. Note that if you subclass
BasePen, you *don't* override moveTo(), lineTo(), etc., but _moveTo(),
_lineTo(), etc. See the BasePen doc string for details. Examples of
BasePen subclasses are fontTools.pens.boundsPen.BoundsPen and
fontTools.pens.cocoaPen.CocoaPen.

Coordinates are usually expressed as (x, y) tuples, but generally any
sequence of length 2 will do.
