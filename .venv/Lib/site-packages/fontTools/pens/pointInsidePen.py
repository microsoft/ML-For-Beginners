    a given point lies inside the shape (black) or outside (white).
    Instances of this class can be recycled, as long as the
    setTestPoint() method is used to set the new point to test.

    Typical usage:

            pen = PointInsidePen(glyphSet, (100, 200))
            outline.draw(pen)
            isInside = pen.getResult()

    Both the even-odd algorithm and the non-zero-winding-rule
    algorithm are implemented. The latter is the default, specify
    True for the evenOdd argument of __init__ or setTestPoint
    to use the even-odd algorithm.
