=========
PointPens
=========

Where **SegmentPens** have an intuitive approach to drawing
(if you're familiar with postscript anyway), the **PointPen**
is geared towards accessing all the data in the contours of
the glyph. A PointPen has a very simple interface, it just
steps through all the points in a call from glyph.drawPoints().
This allows the caller to provide more data for each point.
For instance, whether or not a point is smooth, and its name.
