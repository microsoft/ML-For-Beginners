class Buffer:
    """
    The core data structure that holds the text and cursor position of the
    current input line and implements all text manipulations on top of it. It
    also implements the history, undo stack and the completion state.

    :param completer: :class:`~prompt_toolkit.completion.Completer` instance.
    :param history: :class:`~prompt_toolkit.history.History` instance.
    :param tempfile_suffix: The tempfile suffix (extension) to be used for the
        "open in editor" function. For a Python REPL, this would be ".py", so
        that the editor knows the syntax highlighting to use. This can also be
        a callable that returns a string.
    :param tempfile: For more advanced tempfile situations where you need
        control over the subdirectories and filename. For a Git Commit Message,
        this would be ".git/COMMIT_EDITMSG", so that the editor knows the syntax
        highlighting to use. This can also be a callable that returns a string.
    :param name: Name for this buffer. E.g. DEFAULT_BUFFER. This is mostly
        useful for key bindings where we sometimes prefer to refer to a buffer
        by their name instead of by reference.
    :param accept_handler: Called when the buffer input is accepted. (Usually
        when the user presses `enter`.) The accept handler receives this
        `Buffer` as input and should return True when the buffer text should be
        kept instead of calling reset.

        In case of a `PromptSession` for instance, we want to keep the text,
        because we will exit the application, and only reset it during the next
        run.

    Events:

    :param on_text_changed: When the buffer text changes. (Callable or None.)
    :param on_text_insert: When new text is inserted. (Callable or None.)
    :param on_cursor_position_changed: When the cursor moves. (Callable or None.)
    :param on_completions_changed: When the completions were changed. (Callable or None.)
    :param on_suggestion_set: When an auto-suggestion text has been set. (Callable or None.)

    Filters:

    :param complete_while_typing: :class:`~prompt_toolkit.filters.Filter`
        or `bool`. Decide whether or not to do asynchronous autocompleting while
        typing.
    :param validate_while_typing: :class:`~prompt_toolkit.filters.Filter`
        or `bool`. Decide whether or not to do asynchronous validation while
        typing.
    :param enable_history_search: :class:`~prompt_toolkit.filters.Filter` or
        `bool` to indicate when up-arrow partial string matching is enabled. It
        is advised to not enable this at the same time as
        `complete_while_typing`, because when there is an autocompletion found,
        the up arrows usually browse through the completions, rather than
        through the history.
    :param read_only: :class:`~prompt_toolkit.filters.Filter`. When True,
        changes will not be allowed.
    :param multiline: :class:`~prompt_toolkit.filters.Filter` or `bool`. When
        not set, pressing `Enter` will call the `accept_handler`.  Otherwise,
        pressing `Esc-Enter` is required.
