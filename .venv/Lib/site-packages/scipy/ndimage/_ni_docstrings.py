    position, to define the input to the filter function.
    `footprint` is a boolean array that specifies (implicitly) a
    shape, but also which of the elements within this shape will get
    passed to the filter function. Thus ``size=(n,m)`` is equivalent
    to ``footprint=np.ones((n,m))``.  We adjust `size` to the number
    of dimensions of the input array, so that, if the input array is
