"""
First-order ODE integrators.

User-friendly interface to various numerical integrators for solving a
system of first order ODEs with prescribed initial conditions::

    d y(t)[i]
    ---------  = f(t,y(t))[i],
       d t

    y(t=0)[i] = y0[i],

where::

    i = 0, ..., len(y0) - 1

class ode
---------

A generic interface class to numeric integrators. It has the following
methods::

    integrator = ode(f, jac=None)
    integrator = integrator.set_integrator(name, **params)
    integrator = integrator.set_initial_value(y0, t0=0.0)
    integrator = integrator.set_f_params(*args)
    integrator = integrator.set_jac_params(*args)
    y1 = integrator.integrate(t1, step=False, relax=False)
    flag = integrator.successful()

class complex_ode
-----------------

This class has the same generic interface as ode, except it can handle complex
f, y and Jacobians by transparently translating them into the equivalent
real-valued system. It supports the real-valued solvers (i.e., not zvode) and is
an alternative to ode with the zvode solver, sometimes performing better.

# XXX: Integrators must have:
# ===========================
# cvode - C version of vode and vodpk with many improvements.
#   Get it from http://www.netlib.org/ode/cvode.tar.gz.
#   To wrap cvode to Python, one must write the extension module by
#   hand. Its interface is too much 'advanced C' that using f2py
#   would be too complicated (or impossible).
#
# How to define a new integrator:
# ===============================
#
# class myodeint(IntegratorBase):
#
#     runner = <odeint function> or None
#
#     def __init__(self,...):                           # required
#         <initialize>
#
#     def reset(self,n,has_jac):                        # optional
#         # n - the size of the problem (number of equations)
#         # has_jac - whether user has supplied its own routine for Jacobian
#         <allocate memory,initialize further>
#
#     def run(self,f,jac,y0,t0,t1,f_params,jac_params): # required
#         # this method is called to integrate from t=t0 to t=t1
#         # with initial condition y0. f and jac are user-supplied functions
#         # that define the problem. f_params,jac_params are additional
#         # arguments
#         # to these functions.
#         <calculate y1>
#         if <calculation was unsuccessful>:
#             self.success = 0
#         return t1,y1
#
#     # In addition, one can define step() and run_relax() methods (they
#     # take the same arguments as run()) if the integrator can support
#     # these features (see IntegratorBase doc strings).

class ode:
    """
    A generic interface class to numeric integrators.

    Solve an equation system :math:`y'(t) = f(t,y)` with (optional) ``jac = df/dy``.

    *Note*: The first two arguments of ``f(t, y, ...)`` are in the
    opposite order of the arguments in the system definition function used
    by `scipy.integrate.odeint`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : callable ``f(t, y, *f_args)``
        Right-hand side of the differential equation. t is a scalar,
        ``y.shape == (n,)``.
        ``f_args`` is set by calling ``set_f_params(*args)``.
        `f` should return a scalar, array or list (not a tuple).
    jac : callable ``jac(t, y, *jac_args)``, optional
        Jacobian of the right-hand side, ``jac[i,j] = d f[i] / d y[j]``.
        ``jac_args`` is set by calling ``set_jac_params(*args)``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    t : float
        Current time.
    y : ndarray
        Current variable values.

    Notes
    -----
    Available integrators are listed below. They can be selected using
    the `set_integrator` method.

    "vode"

        Real-valued Variable-coefficient Ordinary Differential Equation
        solver, with fixed-leading-coefficient implementation. It provides
        implicit Adams method (for non-stiff problems) and a method based on
        backward differentiation formulas (BDF) (for stiff problems).

        Source: http://www.netlib.org/ode/vode.f

        .. warning::

           This integrator is not re-entrant. You cannot have two `ode`
           instances using the "vode" integrator at the same time.

        This integrator accepts the following parameters in `set_integrator`
        method of the `ode` class:

        - atol : float or sequence
          absolute tolerance for solution
        - rtol : float or sequence
          relative tolerance for solution
        - lband : None or int
        - uband : None or int
          Jacobian band width, jac[i,j] != 0 for i-lband <= j <= i+uband.
          Setting these requires your jac routine to return the jacobian
          in packed format, jac_packed[i-j+uband, j] = jac[i,j]. The
          dimension of the matrix must be (lband+uband+1, len(y)).
        - method: 'adams' or 'bdf'
          Which solver to use, Adams (non-stiff) or BDF (stiff)
        - with_jacobian : bool
          This option is only considered when the user has not supplied a
          Jacobian function and has not indicated (by setting either band)
          that the Jacobian is banded. In this case, `with_jacobian` specifies
          whether the iteration method of the ODE solver's correction step is
          chord iteration with an internally generated full Jacobian or
          functional iteration with no Jacobian.
        - nsteps : int
          Maximum number of (internally defined) steps allowed during one
          call to the solver.
        - first_step : float
        - min_step : float
        - max_step : float
          Limits for the step sizes used by the integrator.
        - order : int
          Maximum order used by the integrator,
          order <= 12 for Adams, <= 5 for BDF.

    "zvode"

        Complex-valued Variable-coefficient Ordinary Differential Equation
        solver, with fixed-leading-coefficient implementation. It provides
        implicit Adams method (for non-stiff problems) and a method based on
        backward differentiation formulas (BDF) (for stiff problems).

        Source: http://www.netlib.org/ode/zvode.f

        .. warning::

           This integrator is not re-entrant. You cannot have two `ode`
           instances using the "zvode" integrator at the same time.

        This integrator accepts the same parameters in `set_integrator`
        as the "vode" solver.

        .. note::

            When using ZVODE for a stiff system, it should only be used for
            the case in which the function f is analytic, that is, when each f(i)
            is an analytic function of each y(j). Analyticity means that the
            partial derivative df(i)/dy(j) is a unique complex number, and this
            fact is critical in the way ZVODE solves the dense or banded linear
            systems that arise in the stiff case. For a complex stiff ODE system
            in which f is not analytic, ZVODE is likely to have convergence
            failures, and for this problem one should instead use DVODE on the
            equivalent real system (in the real and imaginary parts of y).

    "lsoda"

        Real-valued Variable-coefficient Ordinary Differential Equation
        solver, with fixed-leading-coefficient implementation. It provides
        automatic method switching between implicit Adams method (for non-stiff
        problems) and a method based on backward differentiation formulas (BDF)
        (for stiff problems).

        Source: http://www.netlib.org/odepack

        .. warning::

           This integrator is not re-entrant. You cannot have two `ode`

          call to the solver.
        - first_step : float

        - max_step : float
          Limits for the step sizes used by the integrator.
        - max_order_ns : int
          Maximum order used in the nonstiff case (default 12).
        - max_order_s : int
          Maximum order used in the stiff case (default 5).
        - max_hnil : int
          Maximum number of messages reporting too small step size (t + h = t)
          (default 0)
        - ixpr : int
          Whether to generate extra printing at method switches (default False).
