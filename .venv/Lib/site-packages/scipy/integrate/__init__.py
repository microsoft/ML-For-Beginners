   quadrature roots and weights for other weighting factors and regions.

Solving initial value problems for ODE systems
==============================================

The solvers are implemented as individual classes, which can be used directly
(low-level usage) or through a convenience function.

.. autosummary::

   solve_ivp     -- Convenient function for ODE integration.
   RK23          -- Explicit Runge-Kutta solver of order 3(2).
   RK45          -- Explicit Runge-Kutta solver of order 5(4).
   DOP853        -- Explicit Runge-Kutta solver of order 8.
   Radau         -- Implicit Runge-Kutta solver of order 5.
   BDF           -- Implicit multi-step variable order (1 to 5) solver.
   LSODA         -- LSODA solver from ODEPACK Fortran package.
   OdeSolver     -- Base class for ODE solvers.
   DenseOutput   -- Local interpolant for computing a dense output.
   OdeSolution   -- Class which represents a continuous ODE solution.


Old API
-------

These are the routines developed earlier for SciPy. They wrap older solvers
implemented in Fortran (mostly ODEPACK). While the interface to them is not
particularly convenient and certain features are missing compared to the new
API, the solvers themselves are of good quality and work fast as compiled
Fortran code. In some cases, it might be worth using this old API.
