def pearsonr(x, y):
    r"""
    Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value for testing non-correlation.

    The Pearson correlation coefficient [1]_ measures the linear relationship
    between two datasets.  The calculation of the p-value relies on the
    assumption that each dataset is normally distributed.  (See Kowalski [3]_
    for a discussion of the effects of non-normality of the input on the
    distribution of the correlation coefficient.)  Like other correlation
    coefficients, this one varies between -1 and +1 with 0 implying no
    correlation. Correlations of -1 or +1 imply an exact linear relationship.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : (N,) array_like
        Input array.
    y : (N,) array_like
        Input array.

    Returns
    -------
    r : float
        Pearson's correlation coefficient.
    p-value : float
        Two-tailed p-value.

    Warns
    -----
    PearsonRConstantInputWarning
        Raised if an input is a constant array.  The correlation coefficient
        is not defined in this case, so ``np.nan`` is returned.

    PearsonRNearConstantInputWarning
        Raised if an input is "nearly" constant.  The array ``x`` is considered
        nearly constant if ``norm(x - mean(x)) < 1e-13 * abs(mean(x))``.
        Numerical errors in the calculation ``x - mean(x)`` in this case might
        result in an inaccurate calculation of r.

    See Also
    --------
    spearmanr : Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient.
    kendalltau : Kendall's tau, a correlation measure for ordinal data.

    Notes
    -----
    The correlation coefficient is calculated as follows:

    .. math::

        r = \frac{\sum (x - m_x) (y - m_y)}
                 {\sqrt{\sum (x - m_x)^2 \sum (y - m_y)^2}}

    where :math:`m_x` is the mean of the vector x and :math:`m_y` is
    the mean of the vector y.

    Under the assumption that x and y are drawn from
    independent normal distributions (so the population correlation coefficient
    is 0), the probability density function of the sample correlation
    coefficient r is ([1]_, [2]_):

    .. math::

        f(r) = \frac{{(1-r^2)}^{n/2-2}}{\mathrm{B}(\frac{1}{2},\frac{n}{2}-1)}

    where n is the number of samples, and B is the beta function.  This
    is sometimes referred to as the exact distribution of r.  This is
    the distribution that is used in `pearsonr` to compute the p-value.
    The distribution is a beta distribution on the interval [-1, 1],
    with equal shape parameters a = b = n/2 - 1.  In terms of SciPy's
    implementation of the beta distribution, the distribution of r is::

        dist = scipy.stats.beta(n/2 - 1, n/2 - 1, loc=-1, scale=2)

    The p-value returned by `pearsonr` is a two-sided p-value. The p-value
    roughly indicates the probability of an uncorrelated system
    producing datasets that have a Pearson correlation at least as extreme
    as the one computed from these datasets. More precisely, for a
    given sample with correlation coefficient r, the p-value is
    the probability that abs(r') of a random sample x' and y' drawn from
    the population with zero correlation would be greater than or equal
    to abs(r). In terms of the object ``dist`` shown above, the p-value
    for a given r and length n can be computed as::

        p = 2*dist.cdf(-abs(r))

    When n is 2, the above continuous distribution is not well-defined.
    One can interpret the limit of the beta distribution as the shape
    parameters a and b approach a = b = 0 as a discrete distribution with
    equal probability masses at r = 1 and r = -1.  More directly, one
    can observe that, given the data x = [x1, x2] and y = [y1, y2], and
    assuming x1 != x2 and y1 != y2, the only possible values for r are 1
    and -1.  Because abs(r') for any sample x' and y' with length 2 will
    be 1, the two-sided p-value for a sample of length 2 is always 1.

    Examples

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> from scipy.stats import mstats
    >>> mstats.pearsonr([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [10, 9, 2.5, 6, 4])
    (-0.7426106572325057, 0.1505558088534455)

    There is a linear dependence between x and y if y = a + b*x + e, where
    a,b are constants and e is a random error term, assumed to be independent
    of x. For simplicity, assume that x is standard normal, a=0, b=1 and let
    e follow a normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation s>0.

    >>> s = 0.5
    >>> x = stats.norm.rvs(size=500)
    >>> e = stats.norm.rvs(scale=s, size=500)
    >>> y = x + e
    >>> mstats.pearsonr(x, y)
    (0.9029601878969703, 8.428978827629898e-185) # may vary

    This should be close to the exact value given by

    >>> 1/np.sqrt(1 + s**2)
    0.8944271909999159

    For s=0.5, we observe a high level of correlation. In general, a large
    variance of the noise reduces the correlation, while the correlation
    approaches one as the variance of the error goes to zero.

    It is important to keep in mind that no correlation does not imply
    independence unless (x, y) is jointly normal. Correlation can even be zero
    when there is a very simple dependence structure: if X follows a
    standard normal distribution, let y = abs(x). Note that the correlation
    between x and y is zero. Indeed, since the expectation of x is zero,
    cov(x, y) = E[x*y]. By definition, this equals E[x*abs(x)] which is zero
    by symmetry. The following lines of code illustrate this observation:

    >>> y = np.abs(x)
    >>> mstats.pearsonr(x, y)
    (-0.016172891856853524, 0.7182823678751942) # may vary

    A non-zero correlation coefficient can be misleading. For example, if X has
    a standard normal distribution, define y = x if x < 0 and y = 0 otherwise.
    A simple calculation shows that corr(x, y) = sqrt(2/Pi) = 0.797...,
    implying a high level of correlation:

    >>> y = np.where(x < 0, x, 0)
    >>> mstats.pearsonr(x, y)
    (0.8537091583771509, 3.183461621422181e-143) # may vary

    This is unintuitive since there is no dependence of x and y if x is larger
    than zero which happens in about half of the cases if we sample x and y.

    """
    Calculates a Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient and the p-value
    to test for non-correlation.

    The Spearman correlation is a nonparametric measure of the linear
    relationship between two datasets. Unlike the Pearson correlation, the
    Spearman correlation does not assume that both datasets are normally
    distributed. Like other correlation coefficients, this one varies
    between -1 and +1 with 0 implying no correlation. Correlations of -1 or
    +1 imply a monotonic relationship. Positive correlations imply that
    as `x` increases, so does `y`. Negative correlations imply that as `x`
    increases, `y` decreases.

    Missing values are discarded pair-wise: if a value is missing in `x`, the
    corresponding value in `y` is masked.

    The p-value roughly indicates the probability of an uncorrelated system
    producing datasets that have a Spearman correlation at least as extreme
    as the one computed from these datasets. The p-values are not entirely
    reliable but are probably reasonable for datasets larger than 500 or so.

        One or two 1-D or 2-D arrays containing multiple variables and
        observations. When these are 1-D, each represents a vector of
        observations of a single variable. For the behavior in the 2-D case,
        see under ``axis``, below.
    use_ties : bool, optional
        DO NOT USE.  Does not do anything, keyword is only left in place for
        backwards compatibility reasons.
    axis : int or None, optional
        If axis=0 (default), then each column represents a variable, with
        observations in the rows. If axis=1, the relationship is transposed:
        each row represents a variable, while the columns contain observations.
        If axis=None, then both arrays will be raveled.
    nan_policy : {'propagate', 'raise', 'omit'}, optional
        Defines how to handle when input contains nan. 'propagate' returns nan,
        'raise' throws an error, 'omit' performs the calculations ignoring nan
        values. Default is 'propagate'.
    alternative : {'two-sided', 'less', 'greater'}, optional
        Defines the alternative hypothesis. Default is 'two-sided'.
        The following options are available:

        * 'two-sided': the correlation is nonzero
        * 'less': the correlation is negative (less than zero)
        * 'greater':  the correlation is positive (greater than zero)

    Returns
    -------
    res : SignificanceResult
        An object containing attributes:

        statistic : float or ndarray (2-D square)
            Spearman correlation matrix or correlation coefficient (if only 2
            variables are given as parameters). Correlation matrix is square
            with length equal to total number of variables (columns or rows) in
            ``a`` and ``b`` combined.
        pvalue : float
            The p-value for a hypothesis test whose null hypothesis
            is that two sets of data are linearly uncorrelated. See
            `alternative` above for alternative hypotheses. `pvalue` has the
            same shape as `statistic`.

    Computes the Theil-Sen estimator for a set of points (x, y).

    `theilslopes` implements a method for robust linear regression.  It
    computes the slope as the median of all slopes between paired values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y : array_like
        Dependent variable.
    x : array_like or None, optional
        Independent variable. If None, use ``arange(len(y))`` instead.
    alpha : float, optional

def sen_seasonal_slopes(x):
    r"""
    Computes seasonal Theil-Sen and Kendall slope estimators.

    The seasonal generalization of Sen's slope computes the slopes between all
    pairs of values within a "season" (column) of a 2D array. It returns an
    array containing the median of these "within-season" slopes for each
    season (the Theil-Sen slope estimator of each season), and it returns the
    median of the within-season slopes across all seasons (the seasonal Kendall
    slope estimator).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : 2D array_like
        Each column of `x` contains measurements of the dependent variable
        within a season. The independent variable (usually time) of each season
        is assumed to be ``np.arange(x.shape[0])``.

    Returns
    -------
    result : ``SenSeasonalSlopesResult`` instance
        The return value is an object with the following attributes:

        intra_slope : ndarray
            For each season, the Theil-Sen slope estimator: the median of
            within-season slopes.
        inter_slope : float
            The seasonal Kendall slope estimateor: the median of within-season
            slopes *across all* seasons.

    See Also
    --------
    theilslopes : the analogous function for non-seasonal data
    scipy.stats.theilslopes : non-seasonal slopes for non-masked arrays

    Notes
    -----
    The slopes :math:`d_{ijk}` within season :math:`i` are:

    .. math::

        d_{ijk} = \frac{x_{ij} - x_{ik}}
                            {j - k}

    for pairs of distinct integer indices :math:`j, k` of :math:`x`.

    Element :math:`i` of the returned `intra_slope` array is the median of the
    :math:`d_{ijk}` over all :math:`j < k`; this is the Theil-Sen slope
    estimator of season :math:`i`. The returned `inter_slope` value, better
    known as the seasonal Kendall slope estimator, is the median of the
    :math:`d_{ijk}` over all :math:`i, j, k`.

    Examples
    --------
    Suppose we have 100 observations of a dependent variable for each of four
    seasons:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> x = rng.random(size=(100, 4))

    We compute the seasonal slopes as:

    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> intra_slope, inter_slope = stats.mstats.sen_seasonal_slopes(x)

    If we define a function to compute all slopes between observations within
    a season:

    >>> def dijk(yi):
    ...     n = len(yi)
    ...     x = np.arange(n)
    ...     dy = yi - yi[:, np.newaxis]
    ...     dx = x - x[:, np.newaxis]
    ...     # we only want unique pairs of distinct indices
    ...     mask = np.triu(np.ones((n, n), dtype=bool), k=1)
    ...     return dy[mask]/dx[mask]

    then element ``i`` of ``intra_slope`` is the median of ``dijk[x[:, i]]``:

    >>> i = 2
    >>> np.allclose(np.median(dijk(x[:, i])), intra_slope[i])
    True

    and ``inter_slope`` is the median of the values returned by ``dijk`` for
    all seasons:

    >>> all_slopes = np.concatenate([dijk(x[:, i]) for i in range(x.shape[1])])
    >>> np.allclose(np.median(all_slopes), inter_slope)
    True

    Because the data are randomly generated, we would expect the median slopes
    to be nearly zero both within and across all seasons, and indeed they are:

    >>> intra_slope.data
    array([ 0.00124504, -0.00277761, -0.00221245, -0.00036338])

    Computes empirical quantiles for a data array.

    Samples quantile are defined by ``Q(p) = (1-gamma)*x[j] + gamma*x[j+1]``,
    where ``x[j]`` is the j-th order statistic, and gamma is a function of
    ``j = floor(n*p + m)``, ``m = alphap + p*(1 - alphap - betap)`` and
    ``g = n*p + m - j``.

    Reinterpreting the above equations to compare to **R** lead to the
    equation: ``p(k) = (k - alphap)/(n + 1 - alphap - betap)``

    Typical values of (alphap,betap) are:
        - (0,1)    : ``p(k) = k/n`` : linear interpolation of cdf

        - (.4,.4)  : approximately quantile unbiased (Cunnane)
        - (.35,.35): APL, used with PWM

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data, as a sequence or array of dimension at most 2.
    prob : array_like, optional
        List of quantiles to compute.
    alphap : float, optional
        Plotting positions parameter, default is 0.4.
    betap : float, optional
        Plotting positions parameter, default is 0.4.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which to perform the trimming.
        If None (default), the input array is first flattened.
    limit : tuple, optional
        Tuple of (lower, upper) values.
        Values of `a` outside this open interval are ignored.

    Returns
    -------
    mquantiles : MaskedArray
        An array containing the calculated quantiles.

    Notes
    -----
    This formulation is very similar to **R** except the calculation of
    ``m`` from ``alphap`` and ``betap``, where in **R** ``m`` is defined
    with each type.

    Also sometimes called standard error of measurement.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        An array containing the values for which the standard error is
        returned.
    axis : int or None, optional
        If axis is None, ravel `a` first. If axis is an integer, this will be
        the axis over which to operate. Defaults to 0.
    ddof : int, optional
        Delta degrees-of-freedom. How many degrees of freedom to adjust
        for bias in limited samples relative to the population estimate
        of variance. Defaults to 1.

    Returns
    -------
    s : ndarray or float
        The standard error of the mean in the sample(s), along the input axis.

    Notes
    -----
    The default value for `ddof` changed in scipy 0.15.0 to be consistent with
    `scipy.stats.sem` as well as with the most common definition used (like in
    the R documentation).

    Examples
    --------
    Find standard error along the first axis:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> a = np.arange(20).reshape(5,4)
    >>> print(stats.mstats.sem(a))
    [2.8284271247461903 2.8284271247461903 2.8284271247461903
     2.8284271247461903]

    Find standard error across the whole array, using n degrees of freedom:

    >>> print(stats.mstats.sem(a, axis=None, ddof=0))

    s = a.std(axis=axis, ddof=ddof) / ma.sqrt(n)
