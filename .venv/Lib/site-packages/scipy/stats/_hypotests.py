    Notes
    -----
    Testing whether two samples are generated by the same underlying
    distribution is a classical question in statistics. A widely used test is
    the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test which relies on the empirical
    distribution function. Epps and Singleton introduce a test based on the
    empirical characteristic function in [1]_.

    One advantage of the ES test compared to the KS test is that is does
    not assume a continuous distribution. In [1]_, the authors conclude
    that the test also has a higher power than the KS test in many
    examples. They recommend the use of the ES test for discrete samples as
    well as continuous samples with at least 25 observations each, whereas
    `anderson_ksamp` is recommended for smaller sample sizes in the
    continuous case.

    The p-value is computed from the asymptotic distribution of the test
    statistic which follows a `chi2` distribution. If the sample size of both
    `x` and `y` is below 25, the small sample correction proposed in [1]_ is
    applied to the test statistic.

    The default values of `t` are determined in [1]_ by considering
    various distributions and finding good values that lead to a high power
    of the test in general. Table III in [1]_ gives the optimal values for
    the distributions tested in that study. The values of `t` are scaled by
    the semi-interquartile range in the implementation, see [1]_.

def poisson_means_test(k1, n1, k2, n2, *, diff=0, alternative='two-sided'):
    r"""
    Performs the Poisson means test, AKA the "E-test".

    This is a test of the null hypothesis that the difference between means of
    two Poisson distributions is `diff`. The samples are provided as the
    number of events `k1` and `k2` observed within measurement intervals
    (e.g. of time, space, number of observations) of sizes `n1` and `n2`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    k1 : int
        Number of events observed from distribution 1.
    n1: float
        Size of sample from distribution 1.
    k2 : int
        Number of events observed from distribution 2.
    n2 : float
        Size of sample from distribution 2.
    diff : float, default=0
        The hypothesized difference in means between the distributions
        underlying the samples.
    alternative : {'two-sided', 'less', 'greater'}, optional
        Defines the alternative hypothesis.
        The following options are available (default is 'two-sided'):

          * 'two-sided': the difference between distribution means is not
            equal to `diff`
          * 'less': the difference between distribution means is less than
            `diff`
          * 'greater': the difference between distribution means is greater
            than `diff`

    Returns
    -------
    statistic : float
        The test statistic (see [1]_ equation 3.3).
    pvalue : float
        The probability of achieving such an extreme value of the test
        statistic under the null hypothesis.

    Notes
    -----

    Let:

    .. math:: X_1 \sim \mbox{Poisson}(\mathtt{n1}\lambda_1)

    be a random variable independent of

    .. math:: X_2  \sim \mbox{Poisson}(\mathtt{n2}\lambda_2)

    and let ``k1`` and ``k2`` be the observed values of :math:`X_1`
    and :math:`X_2`, respectively. Then `poisson_means_test` uses the number
    of observed events ``k1`` and ``k2`` from samples of size ``n1`` and
    ``n2``, respectively, to test the null hypothesis that

    .. math::
       H_0: \lambda_1 - \lambda_2 = \mathtt{diff}

    A benefit of the E-test is that it has good power for small sample sizes,
    which can reduce sampling costs [1]_. It has been evaluated and determined
    to be more powerful than the comparable C-test, sometimes referred to as
    the Poisson exact test.

    Examples
    --------

    Suppose that a gardener wishes to test the number of dodder (weed) seeds
    in a sack of clover seeds that they buy from a seed company. It has
    previously been established that the number of dodder seeds in clover
    follows the Poisson distribution.

    A 100 gram sample is drawn from the sack before being shipped to the
    gardener. The sample is analyzed, and it is found to contain no dodder
    seeds; that is, `k1` is 0. However, upon arrival, the gardener draws
    another 100 gram sample from the sack. This time, three dodder seeds are
    found in the sample; that is, `k2` is 3. The gardener would like to
    know if the difference is significant and not due to chance. The
    null hypothesis is that the difference between the two samples is merely
    due to chance, or that :math:`\lambda_1 - \lambda_2 = \mathtt{diff}`
    where :math:`\mathtt{diff} = 0`. The alternative hypothesis is that the
    difference is not due to chance, or :math:`\lambda_1 - \lambda_2 \ne 0`.
    The gardener selects a significance level of 5% to reject the null
    hypothesis in favor of the alternative [2]_.

    >>> import scipy.stats as stats
    >>> res = stats.poisson_means_test(0, 100, 3, 100)
    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue
    (-1.7320508075688772, 0.08837900929018157)

    The p-value is .088, indicating a near 9% chance of observing a value of
    the test statistic under the null hypothesis. This exceeds 5%, so the
    gardener does not reject the null hypothesis as the difference cannot be
    regarded as significant at this level.

    .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

    The p-value relies on the approximation given by equation 1.8 in [2]_.
    It is important to keep in mind that the p-value is only accurate if
    one tests a simple hypothesis, i.e. the parameters of the reference
    distribution are known. If the parameters are estimated from the data
    (composite hypothesis), the computed p-value is not reliable.

    Examples
    --------

    Suppose we wish to test whether data generated by ``scipy.stats.norm.rvs``
    were, in fact, drawn from the standard normal distribution. We choose a
    significance level of ``alpha=0.05``.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(165417232101553420507139617764912913465)
    >>> x = stats.norm.rvs(size=500, random_state=rng)
    >>> res = stats.cramervonmises(x, 'norm')
    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue
    (0.1072085112565724, 0.5508482238203407)

    The p-value exceeds our chosen significance level, so we do not
    reject the null hypothesis that the observed sample is drawn from the
    standard normal distribution.

    Now suppose we wish to check whether the same samples shifted by 2.1 is
    consistent with being drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 2.

    >>> y = x + 2.1
    >>> res = stats.cramervonmises(y, 'norm', args=(2,))
    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue
    (0.8364446265294695, 0.00596286797008283)

    Here we have used the `args` keyword to specify the mean (``loc``)
    of the normal distribution to test the data against. This is equivalent
    to the following, in which we create a frozen normal distribution with
    mean 2.1, then pass its ``cdf`` method as an argument.

    >>> frozen_dist = stats.norm(loc=2)
    >>> res = stats.cramervonmises(y, frozen_dist.cdf)
    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue
    (0.8364446265294695, 0.00596286797008283)

    In either case, we would reject the null hypothesis that the observed
    sample is drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 2 (and default
    variance of 1) because the p-value is less than our chosen
    significance level.

def somersd(x, y=None, alternative='two-sided'):
    r"""Calculates Somers' D, an asymmetric measure of ordinal association.

    Like Kendall's :math:`\tau`, Somers' :math:`D` is a measure of the
    correspondence between two rankings. Both statistics consider the
    difference between the number of concordant and discordant pairs in two
    rankings :math:`X` and :math:`Y`, and both are normalized such that values
    close  to 1 indicate strong agreement and values close to -1 indicate
    strong disagreement. They differ in how they are normalized. To show the
    relationship, Somers' :math:`D` can be defined in terms of Kendall's
    :math:`\tau_a`:

    .. math::
        D(Y|X) = \frac{\tau_a(X, Y)}{\tau_a(X, X)}

    Suppose the first ranking :math:`X` has :math:`r` distinct ranks and the
    second ranking :math:`Y` has :math:`s` distinct ranks. These two lists of
    :math:`n` rankings can also be viewed as an :math:`r \times s` contingency
    table in which element :math:`i, j` is the number of rank pairs with rank
    :math:`i` in ranking :math:`X` and rank :math:`j` in ranking :math:`Y`.
    Accordingly, `somersd` also allows the input data to be supplied as a
    single, 2D contingency table instead of as two separate, 1D rankings.

    Note that the definition of Somers' :math:`D` is asymmetric: in general,
    :math:`D(Y|X) \neq D(X|Y)`. ``somersd(x, y)`` calculates Somers'
    :math:`D(Y|X)`: the "row" variable :math:`X` is treated as an independent
    variable, and the "column" variable :math:`Y` is dependent. For Somers'
    :math:`D(X|Y)`, swap the input lists or transpose the input table.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        1D array of rankings, treated as the (row) independent variable.
        Alternatively, a 2D contingency table.
    y : array_like, optional
        If `x` is a 1D array of rankings, `y` is a 1D array of rankings of the
        same length, treated as the (column) dependent variable.
        If `x` is 2D, `y` is ignored.
    alternative : {'two-sided', 'less', 'greater'}, optional
        Defines the alternative hypothesis. Default is 'two-sided'.
        The following options are available:
        * 'two-sided': the rank correlation is nonzero
        * 'less': the rank correlation is negative (less than zero)
        * 'greater':  the rank correlation is positive (greater than zero)

    Returns
    -------
    res : SomersDResult
        A `SomersDResult` object with the following fields:

            statistic : float
               The Somers' :math:`D` statistic.
            pvalue : float
               The p-value for a hypothesis test whose null
               hypothesis is an absence of association, :math:`D=0`.
               See notes for more information.
            table : 2D array
               The contingency table formed from rankings `x` and `y` (or the
               provided contingency table, if `x` is a 2D array)

    Notes
    -----
    This function follows the contingency table approach of [2]_ and
    [3]_. *p*-values are computed based on an asymptotic approximation of
    the test statistic distribution under the null hypothesis :math:`D=0`.

    Theoretically, hypothesis tests based on Kendall's :math:`tau` and Somers'
    :math:`D` should be identical.
    However, the *p*-values returned by `kendalltau` are based
    on the null hypothesis of *independence* between :math:`X` and :math:`Y`
    (i.e. the population from which pairs in :math:`X` and :math:`Y` are
    sampled contains equal numbers of all possible pairs), which is more
    specific than the null hypothesis :math:`D=0` used here. If the null
    hypothesis of independence is desired, it is acceptable to use the
    *p*-value returned by `kendalltau` with the statistic returned by
    `somersd` and vice versa. For more information, see [2]_.

    Contingency tables are formatted according to the convention used by
    SAS and R: the first ranking supplied (``x``) is the "row" variable, and
    the second ranking supplied (``y``) is the "column" variable. This is
    opposite the convention of Somers' original paper [1]_.

    Examples
    --------
    We calculate Somers' D for the example given in [4]_, in which a hotel
    chain owner seeks to determine the association between hotel room
    cleanliness and customer satisfaction. The independent variable, hotel
    room cleanliness, is ranked on an ordinal scale: "below average (1)",
    "average (2)", or "above average (3)". The dependent variable, customer
    satisfaction, is ranked on a second scale: "very dissatisfied (1)",
    "moderately dissatisfied (2)", "neither dissatisfied nor satisfied (3)",
    "moderately satisfied (4)", or "very satisfied (5)". 189 customers
    respond to the survey, and the results are cast into a contingency table
    with the hotel room cleanliness as the "row" variable and customer
    satisfaction as the "column" variable.

    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |     | (1) | (2) | (3) | (4) | (5) |
    +=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
    | (1) | 27  | 25  | 14  | 7   | 0   |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    | (2) | 7   | 14  | 18  | 35  | 12  |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    | (3) | 1   | 3   | 2   | 7   | 17  |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

    For example, 27 customers assigned their room a cleanliness ranking of
    "below average (1)" and a corresponding satisfaction of "very
    dissatisfied (1)". We perform the analysis as follows.

    >>> from scipy.stats import somersd
    >>> table = [[27, 25, 14, 7, 0], [7, 14, 18, 35, 12], [1, 3, 2, 7, 17]]
    >>> res = somersd(table)
    >>> res.statistic
    0.6032766111513396
    >>> res.pvalue
    1.0007091191074533e-27

    The value of the Somers' D statistic is approximately 0.6, indicating
    a positive correlation between room cleanliness and customer satisfaction
    in the sample.
    The *p*-value is very small, indicating a very small probability of
    observing such an extreme value of the statistic under the null
    hypothesis that the statistic of the entire population (from which
    our sample of 189 customers is drawn) is zero. This supports the
    alternative hypothesis that the true value of Somers' D for the population
    is nonzero.

    Notes
    -----
    Barnard's test is an exact test used in the analysis of contingency
    tables. It examines the association of two categorical variables, and
    is a more powerful alternative than Fisher's exact test
    for 2x2 contingency tables.

    Let's define :math:`X_0` a 2x2 matrix representing the observed sample,
    where each column stores the binomial experiment, as in the example
    below. Let's also define :math:`p_1, p_2` the theoretical binomial
    probabilities for  :math:`x_{11}` and :math:`x_{12}`. When using
    Barnard exact test, we can assert three different null hypotheses :

    - :math:`H_0 : p_1 \geq p_2` versus :math:`H_1 : p_1 < p_2`,
      with `alternative` = "less"

    - :math:`H_0 : p_1 \leq p_2` versus :math:`H_1 : p_1 > p_2`,
      with `alternative` = "greater"

    - :math:`H_0 : p_1 = p_2` versus :math:`H_1 : p_1 \neq p_2`,
      with `alternative` = "two-sided" (default one)

    In order to compute Barnard's exact test, we are using the Wald
    statistic [3]_ with pooled or unpooled variance.
    Under the default assumption that both variances are equal
    (``pooled = True``), the statistic is computed as:

    .. math::

        T(X) = \frac{
            \hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2
        }{
            \sqrt{
                \hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})
                (\frac{1}{c_1} +
                \frac{1}{c_2})
            }
        }

    with :math:`\hat{p}_1, \hat{p}_2` and :math:`\hat{p}` the estimator of
    :math:`p_1, p_2` and :math:`p`, the latter being the combined probability,
    given the assumption that :math:`p_1 = p_2`.

    If this assumption is invalid (``pooled = False``), the statistic is:

    .. math::

        T(X) = \frac{
            \hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2
        }{
            \sqrt{
                \frac{\hat{p}_1 (1 - \hat{p}_1)}{c_1} +
                \frac{\hat{p}_2 (1 - \hat{p}_2)}{c_2}
            }
        }

    The p-value is then computed as:

    .. math::

        \sum
            \binom{c_1}{x_{11}}
            \binom{c_2}{x_{12}}
            \pi^{x_{11} + x_{12}}
            (1 - \pi)^{t - x_{11} - x_{12}}

    where the sum is over all  2x2 contingency tables :math:`X` such that:
    * :math:`T(X) \leq T(X_0)` when `alternative` = "less",
    * :math:`T(X) \geq T(X_0)` when `alternative` = "greater", or
    * :math:`T(X) \geq |T(X_0)|` when `alternative` = "two-sided".
    Above, :math:`c_1, c_2` are the sum of the columns 1 and 2,
    and :math:`t` the total (sum of the 4 sample's element).

    The returned p-value is the maximum p-value taken over the nuisance

    Examples
    --------
    An example use of Barnard's test is presented in [2]_.

        Consider the following example of a vaccine efficacy study
        (Chan, 1998). In a randomized clinical trial of 30 subjects, 15 were
        inoculated with a recombinant DNA influenza vaccine and the 15 were
        inoculated with a placebo. Twelve of the 15 subjects in the placebo
        group (80%) eventually became infected with influenza whereas for the
        vaccine group, only 7 of the 15 subjects (47%) became infected. The
        data are tabulated as a 2 x 2 table::

                Vaccine  Placebo
            Yes     7        12
            No      8        3

    When working with statistical hypothesis testing, we usually use a
    threshold probability or significance level upon which we decide
    to reject the null hypothesis :math:`H_0`. Suppose we choose the common
    significance level of 5%.

    Our alternative hypothesis is that the vaccine will lower the chance of
    becoming infected with the virus; that is, the probability :math:`p_1` of
    catching the virus with the vaccine will be *less than* the probability
    :math:`p_2` of catching the virus without the vaccine.  Therefore, we call
    `barnard_exact` with the ``alternative="less"`` option:

    >>> import scipy.stats as stats
    >>> res = stats.barnard_exact([[7, 12], [8, 3]], alternative="less")
    >>> res.statistic
    -1.894...
    >>> res.pvalue
    0.03407...

    Under the null hypothesis that the vaccine will not lower the chance of
    becoming infected, the probability of obtaining test results at least as
    extreme as the observed data is approximately 3.4%. Since this p-value is
    less than our chosen significance level, we have evidence to reject
    :math:`H_0` in favor of the alternative.

    Suppose we had used Fisher's exact test instead:

    >>> _, pvalue = stats.fisher_exact([[7, 12], [8, 3]], alternative="less")
    >>> pvalue
    0.0640...

    With the same threshold significance of 5%, we would not have been able
    to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. As stated in
    [2]_, Barnard's test is uniformly more powerful than Fisher's exact test
    because Barnard's test does not condition on any margin. Fisher's test
    should only be used when both sets of marginals are fixed.

        Please see explanations in the Notes section below.

    n : int, optional
        Number of sampling points used in the construction of the sampling

    Notes
    -----
    Boschloo's test is an exact test used in the analysis of contingency
    tables. It examines the association of two categorical variables, and
    is a uniformly more powerful alternative to Fisher's exact test
    for 2x2 contingency tables.

    Boschloo's exact test uses the p-value of Fisher's exact test as a
    statistic, and Boschloo's p-value is the probability under the null
    hypothesis of observing such an extreme value of this statistic.

    Let's define :math:`X_0` a 2x2 matrix representing the observed sample,
    where each column stores the binomial experiment, as in the example
    below. Let's also define :math:`p_1, p_2` the theoretical binomial
    probabilities for  :math:`x_{11}` and :math:`x_{12}`. When using
    Boschloo exact test, we can assert three different alternative hypotheses:

    - :math:`H_0 : p_1=p_2` versus :math:`H_1 : p_1 < p_2`,
      with `alternative` = "less"

    - :math:`H_0 : p_1=p_2` versus :math:`H_1 : p_1 > p_2`,
      with `alternative` = "greater"

    - :math:`H_0 : p_1=p_2` versus :math:`H_1 : p_1 \neq p_2`,
      with `alternative` = "two-sided" (default)

    There are multiple conventions for computing a two-sided p-value when the
    null distribution is asymmetric. Here, we apply the convention that the
    p-value of a two-sided test is twice the minimum of the p-values of the
    one-sided tests (clipped to 1.0). Note that `fisher_exact` follows a
    different convention, so for a given `table`, the statistic reported by
    `boschloo_exact` may differ from the p-value reported by `fisher_exact`
    when ``alternative='two-sided'``.

    Examples
    --------
    In the following example, we consider the article "Employee
    attitudes and job satisfaction" [3]_
    which reports the results of a survey from 63 scientists and 117 college
    professors. Of the 63 scientists, 31 said they were very satisfied with
    their jobs, whereas 74 of the college professors were very satisfied
    with their work. Is this significant evidence that college
    professors are happier with their work than scientists?
    The following table summarizes the data mentioned above::

                         college professors   scientists
        Very Satisfied   74                     31
        Dissatisfied     43                     32

    When working with statistical hypothesis testing, we usually use a
    threshold probability or significance level upon which we decide
    to reject the null hypothesis :math:`H_0`. Suppose we choose the common
    significance level of 5%.

    Our alternative hypothesis is that college professors are truly more
    satisfied with their work than scientists. Therefore, we expect
    :math:`p_1` the proportion of very satisfied college professors to be
    greater than :math:`p_2`, the proportion of very satisfied scientists.
    We thus call `boschloo_exact` with the ``alternative="greater"`` option:

    >>> import scipy.stats as stats
    >>> res = stats.boschloo_exact([[74, 31], [43, 32]], alternative="greater")
    >>> res.statistic
    0.0483...
    >>> res.pvalue
    0.0355...

    Under the null hypothesis that scientists are happier in their work than
    college professors, the probability of obtaining test
    results at least as extreme as the observed data is approximately 3.55%.
    Since this p-value is less than our chosen significance level, we have
    evidence to reject :math:`H_0` in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

    Notes

    Both Barnard's test and Boschloo's test iterate over a nuisance parameter
    :math:`\pi \in [0, 1]` to find the maximum p-value. To search this
    maxima, this function return the negative log pvalue with respect to the
    nuisance parameter passed in params. This negative log p-value is then
    used in `shgo` to find the minimum negative pvalue which is our maximum
    pvalue.

    Also, to compute the different combination used in the
    p-values' computation formula, this function uses `gammaln` which is
    more tolerant for large value than `scipy.special.comb`. `gammaln` gives
    a log combination. For the little precision loss, performances are

    Notes

    The statistic is computed according to equation 9 in [2]_. The
    calculation of the p-value depends on the keyword `method`:

    - ``asymptotic``: The p-value is approximated by using the limiting
      distribution of the test statistic.
    - ``exact``: The exact p-value is computed by enumerating all
      possible combinations of the test statistic, see [2]_.

    If ``method='auto'``, the exact approach is used
    if both samples contain equal to or less than 20 observations,
    otherwise the asymptotic distribution is used.

    If the underlying distribution is not continuous, the p-value is likely to
    be conservative (Section 6.2 in [3]_). When ranking the data to compute
    the test statistic, midranks are used if there are ties.

    Examples
    --------

    Suppose we wish to test whether two samples generated by
    ``scipy.stats.norm.rvs`` have the same distribution. We choose a
    significance level of alpha=0.05.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> x = stats.norm.rvs(size=100, random_state=rng)
    >>> y = stats.norm.rvs(size=70, random_state=rng)
    >>> res = stats.cramervonmises_2samp(x, y)
    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue
    (0.29376470588235293, 0.1412873014573014)

    The p-value exceeds our chosen significance level, so we do not
    reject the null hypothesis that the observed samples are drawn from the
    same distribution.

    For small sample sizes, one can compute the exact p-values:

    >>> x = stats.norm.rvs(size=7, random_state=rng)
    >>> y = stats.t.rvs(df=2, size=6, random_state=rng)
    >>> res = stats.cramervonmises_2samp(x, y, method='exact')
    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue
    (0.197802197802198, 0.31643356643356646)

    The p-value based on the asymptotic distribution is a good approximation
    even though the sample size is small.

    >>> res = stats.cramervonmises_2samp(x, y, method='asymptotic')
    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue
    (0.197802197802198, 0.2966041181527128)

    Independent of the method, one would not reject the null hypothesis at the
    chosen significance level in this example.

    Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test performs pairwise

    assesses whether the true means underlying each sample are identical,
    Tukey's HSD is a post hoc test used to compare the mean of each sample
    to the mean of each other sample.

    The null hypothesis is that the distributions underlying the samples all
    have the same mean. The test statistic, which is computed for every
    possible pairing of samples, is simply the difference between the sample
    means. For each pair, the p-value is the probability under the null
    hypothesis (and other assumptions; see notes) of observing such an extreme
    value of the statistic, considering that many pairwise comparisons are
    being performed. Confidence intervals for the difference between each pair
    of means are also available.

    Notes
    -----
    The use of this test relies on several assumptions.

    1. The observations are independent within and among groups.
    2. The observations within each group are normally distributed.
    3. The distributions from which the samples are drawn have the same finite
       variance.

    The original formulation of the test was for samples of equal size [6]_.
    In case of unequal sample sizes, the test uses the Tukey-Kramer method
    [4]_.

    Here are some data comparing the time to relief of three brands of
    headache medicine, reported in minutes. Data adapted from [3]_.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy.stats import tukey_hsd
    >>> group0 = [24.5, 23.5, 26.4, 27.1, 29.9]

    >>> group2 = [26.1, 28.3, 24.3, 26.2, 27.8]

    We would like to see if the means between any of the groups are
    significantly different. First, visually examine a box and whisker plot.

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)
    >>> ax.boxplot([group0, group1, group2])
    >>> ax.set_xticklabels(["group0", "group1", "group2"]) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax.set_ylabel("mean") # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> plt.show()

    From the box and whisker plot, we can see overlap in the interquartile
    ranges group 1 to group 2 and group 3, but we can apply the ``tukey_hsd``
    test to determine if the difference between means is significant. We
    set a significance level of .05 to reject the null hypothesis.

    >>> res = tukey_hsd(group0, group1, group2)
    >>> print(res)
    Tukey's HSD Pairwise Group Comparisons (95.0% Confidence Interval)
    Comparison  Statistic  p-value   Lower CI   Upper CI
    (0 - 1)     -4.600      0.014     -8.249     -0.951

    (2 - 0)      0.260      0.980     -3.389      3.909
    (2 - 1)     -4.340      0.020     -7.989     -0.691

    The null hypothesis is that each group has the same mean. The p-value for
    comparisons between ``group0`` and ``group1`` as well as ``group1`` and
    ``group2`` do not exceed .05, so we reject the null hypothesis that they
    have the same means. The p-value of the comparison between ``group0``
    and ``group2`` exceeds .05, so we accept the null hypothesis that there
    is not a significant difference between their means.

    We can also compute the confidence interval associated with our chosen
    confidence level.

    >>> group0 = [24.5, 23.5, 26.4, 27.1, 29.9]
