SciPy ``optimize`` provides functions for minimizing (or maximizing)
objective functions, possibly subject to constraints. It includes
solvers for nonlinear problems (with support for both local and global
optimization algorithms), linear programming, constrained
and nonlinear least-squares, root finding, and curve fitting.

Common functions and objects, shared across different solvers, are:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   show_options - Show specific options optimization solvers.
   OptimizeResult - The optimization result returned by some optimizers.
   OptimizeWarning - The optimization encountered problems.


Optimization
============

   :toctree: generated/

The `minimize_scalar` function supports the following methods:

.. toctree::

   optimize.minimize_scalar-brent
   optimize.minimize_scalar-bounded
   optimize.minimize_scalar-golden

Local (multivariate) optimization
---------------------------------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   optimize.minimize-trustconstr
   optimize.minimize-dogleg
   optimize.minimize-trustncg

Constraints are passed to `minimize` function as a single object or
as a list of objects from the following classes:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   NonlinearConstraint - Class defining general nonlinear constraints.
   LinearConstraint - Class defining general linear constraints.

Simple bound constraints are handled separately and there is a special class
for them:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   Bounds - Bound constraints.

Quasi-Newton strategies implementing `HessianUpdateStrategy`
interface can be used to approximate the Hessian in `minimize`
function (available only for the 'trust-constr' method). Available
quasi-Newton methods implementing this interface are:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   BFGS - Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) Hessian update strategy.
   SR1 - Symmetric-rank-1 Hessian update strategy.

.. _global_optimization:

   :toctree: generated/

   basinhopping - Basinhopping stochastic optimizer.
   brute - Brute force searching optimizer.
   differential_evolution - Stochastic optimizer using differential evolution.

   shgo - Simplicial homology global optimizer.
   dual_annealing - Dual annealing stochastic optimizer.
   direct - DIRECT (Dividing Rectangles) optimizer.

Least-squares and curve fitting

Curve fitting
-------------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   curve_fit -- Fit curve to a set of points.

Root finding
============

Scalar functions
----------------
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   root_scalar - Unified interface for nonlinear solvers of scalar functions.
   brentq - quadratic interpolation Brent method.
   brenth - Brent method, modified by Harris with hyperbolic extrapolation.
   ridder - Ridder's method.
   bisect - Bisection method.
   newton - Newton's method (also Secant and Halley's methods).
   toms748 - Alefeld, Potra & Shi Algorithm 748.
   RootResults - The root finding result returned by some root finders.

The `root_scalar` function supports the following methods:

.. toctree::

   optimize.root_scalar-brentq
   optimize.root_scalar-brenth
   optimize.root_scalar-bisect
   optimize.root_scalar-ridder
   optimize.root_scalar-newton
   optimize.root_scalar-toms748
   optimize.root_scalar-secant
   optimize.root_scalar-halley



The table below lists situations and appropriate methods, along with
*asymptotic* convergence rates per iteration (and per function evaluation)
for successful convergence to a simple root(*).
Bisection is the slowest of them all, adding one bit of accuracy for each
function evaluation, but is guaranteed to converge.
The other bracketing methods all (eventually) increase the number of accurate
bits by about 50% for every function evaluation.
The derivative-based methods, all built on `newton`, can converge quite quickly
if the initial value is close to the root.  They can also be applied to
functions defined on (a subset of) the complex plane.
