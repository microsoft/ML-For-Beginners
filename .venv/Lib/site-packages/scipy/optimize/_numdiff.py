    called the Jacobian, where an element (i, j) is a partial derivative of
    f[i] with respect to x[j].

    Parameters
    ----------
    fun : callable
        Function of which to estimate the derivatives. The argument x
        passed to this function is ndarray of shape (n,) (never a scalar
        even if n=1). It must return 1-D array_like of shape (m,) or a scalar.
    x0 : array_like of shape (n,) or float
        Point at which to estimate the derivatives. Float will be converted
        to a 1-D array.
    method : {'3-point', '2-point', 'cs'}, optional
        Finite difference method to use:
            - '2-point' - use the first order accuracy forward or backward
                          difference.
            - '3-point' - use central difference in interior points and the
                          second order accuracy forward or backward difference
                          near the boundary.
            - 'cs' - use a complex-step finite difference scheme. This assumes
                     that the user function is real-valued and can be
                     analytically continued to the complex plane. Otherwise,
                     produces bogus results.
    rel_step : None or array_like, optional
        Relative step size to use. If None (default) the absolute step size is
        computed as ``h = rel_step * sign(x0) * max(1, abs(x0))``, with
        `rel_step` being selected automatically, see Notes. Otherwise
        ``h = rel_step * sign(x0) * abs(x0)``. For ``method='3-point'`` the
        sign of `h` is ignored. The calculated step size is possibly adjusted
        to fit into the bounds.
    abs_step : array_like, optional
        Absolute step size to use, possibly adjusted to fit into the bounds.
        For ``method='3-point'`` the sign of `abs_step` is ignored. By default
        relative steps are used, only if ``abs_step is not None`` are absolute
        steps used.
    f0 : None or array_like, optional
        If not None it is assumed to be equal to ``fun(x0)``, in this case
        the ``fun(x0)`` is not called. Default is None.
    bounds : tuple of array_like, optional
        Lower and upper bounds on independent variables. Defaults to no bounds.
        Each bound must match the size of `x0` or be a scalar, in the latter
        case the bound will be the same for all variables. Use it to limit the
        range of function evaluation. Bounds checking is not implemented
        when `as_linear_operator` is True.
    sparsity : {None, array_like, sparse matrix, 2-tuple}, optional
        Defines a sparsity structure of the Jacobian matrix. If the Jacobian
        matrix is known to have only few non-zero elements in each row, then
        it's possible to estimate its several columns by a single function
        evaluation [3]_. To perform such economic computations two ingredients
        are required:

        * structure : array_like or sparse matrix of shape (m, n). A zero
          element means that a corresponding element of the Jacobian
          identically equals to zero.
        * groups : array_like of shape (n,). A column grouping for a given
          sparsity structure, use `group_columns` to obtain it.

        A single array or a sparse matrix is interpreted as a sparsity
        structure, and groups are computed inside the function. A tuple is
        interpreted as (structure, groups). If None (default), a standard
        dense differencing will be used.

        Note, that sparse differencing makes sense only for large Jacobian
        matrices where each row contains few non-zero elements.
    as_linear_operator : bool, optional
        When True the function returns an `scipy.sparse.linalg.LinearOperator`.
        Otherwise it returns a dense array or a sparse matrix depending on
        `sparsity`. The linear operator provides an efficient way of computing
        ``J.dot(p)`` for any vector ``p`` of shape (n,), but does not allow
        direct access to individual elements of the matrix. By default
        `as_linear_operator` is False.
    args, kwargs : tuple and dict, optional
        Additional arguments passed to `fun`. Both empty by default.
        The calling signature is ``fun(x, *args, **kwargs)``.

    Returns
    -------
    J : {ndarray, sparse matrix, LinearOperator}
        Finite difference approximation of the Jacobian matrix.
        If `as_linear_operator` is True returns a LinearOperator
        with shape (m, n). Otherwise it returns a dense array or sparse
        matrix depending on how `sparsity` is defined. If `sparsity`
        is None then a ndarray with shape (m, n) is returned. If
        `sparsity` is not None returns a csr_matrix with shape (m, n).
        For sparse matrices and linear operators it is always returned as
        a 2-D structure, for ndarrays, if m=1 it is returned
        as a 1-D gradient array with shape (n,).

    See Also
    --------
    check_derivative : Check correctness of a function computing derivatives.

    Notes
    -----
    If `rel_step` is not provided, it assigned as ``EPS**(1/s)``, where EPS is
    determined from the smallest floating point dtype of `x0` or `fun(x0)`,
    ``np.finfo(x0.dtype).eps``, s=2 for '2-point' method and
    s=3 for '3-point' method. Such relative step approximately minimizes a sum
    of truncation and round-off errors, see [1]_. Relative steps are used by
    default. However, absolute steps are used when ``abs_step is not None``.
    If any of the absolute or relative steps produces an indistinguishable
    difference from the original `x0`, ``(x0 + dx) - x0 == 0``, then a
    automatic step size is substituted for that particular entry.

    A finite difference scheme for '3-point' method is selected automatically.
    The well-known central difference scheme is used for points sufficiently
    far from the boundary, and 3-point forward or backward scheme is used for
    points near the boundary. Both schemes have the second-order accuracy in
    terms of Taylor expansion. Refer to [2]_ for the formulas of 3-point
    forward and backward difference schemes.

    For dense differencing when m=1 Jacobian is returned with a shape (n,),
    on the other hand when n=1 Jacobian is returned with a shape (m, 1).
    Our motivation is the following: a) It handles a case of gradient
    computation (m=1) in a conventional way. b) It clearly separates these two
    different cases. b) In all cases np.atleast_2d can be called to get 2-D
    Jacobian with correct dimensions.

    """Check correctness of a function computing derivatives (Jacobian or
    gradient) by comparison with a finite difference approximation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fun : callable
        Function of which to estimate the derivatives. The argument x
        passed to this function is ndarray of shape (n,) (never a scalar
        even if n=1). It must return 1-D array_like of shape (m,) or a scalar.
    jac : callable
        Function which computes Jacobian matrix of `fun`. It must work with
        argument x the same way as `fun`. The return value must be array_like
        or sparse matrix with an appropriate shape.
    x0 : array_like of shape (n,) or float
        Point at which to estimate the derivatives. Float will be converted
        to 1-D array.
    bounds : 2-tuple of array_like, optional
        Lower and upper bounds on independent variables. Defaults to no bounds.
        Each bound must match the size of `x0` or be a scalar, in the latter
        case the bound will be the same for all variables. Use it to limit the
        range of function evaluation.
    args, kwargs : tuple and dict, optional
        Additional arguments passed to `fun` and `jac`. Both empty by default.
        The calling signature is ``fun(x, *args, **kwargs)`` and the same
        for `jac`.

    Returns
    -------
    accuracy : float
        The maximum among all relative errors for elements with absolute values
        higher than 1 and absolute errors for elements with absolute values
        less or equal than 1. If `accuracy` is on the order of 1e-6 or lower,
        then it is likely that your `jac` implementation is correct.
