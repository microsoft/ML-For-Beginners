K-means clustering and vector quantization (:mod:`scipy.cluster.vq`)
====================================================================

Provides routines for k-means clustering, generating code books
from k-means models and quantizing vectors by comparing them with
centroids in a code book.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   whiten -- Normalize a group of observations so each feature has unit variance
   vq -- Calculate code book membership of a set of observation vectors
   kmeans -- Perform k-means on a set of observation vectors forming k clusters
   kmeans2 -- A different implementation of k-means with more methods
           -- for initializing centroids

Background information
----------------------
The k-means algorithm takes as input the number of clusters to
generate, k, and a set of observation vectors to cluster. It
returns a set of centroids, one for each of the k clusters. An
observation vector is classified with the cluster number or
centroid index of the centroid closest to it.

A vector v belongs to cluster i if it is closer to centroid i than
any other centroid. If v belongs to i, we say centroid i is the
dominating centroid of v. The k-means algorithm tries to
minimize distortion, which is defined as the sum of the squared distances
between each observation vector and its dominating centroid.
The minimization is achieved by iteratively reclassifying
the observations into clusters and recalculating the centroids until
a configuration is reached in which the centroids are stable. One can
also define a maximum number of iterations.

Since vector quantization is a natural application for k-means,
information theory terminology is often used. The centroid index
or cluster index is also referred to as a "code" and the table
mapping codes to centroids and, vice versa, is often referred to as a
"code book". The result of k-means, a set of centroids, can be
used to quantize vectors. Quantization aims to find an encoding of
vectors that reduces the expected distortion.

All routines expect obs to be an M by N array, where the rows are
the observation vectors. The codebook is a k by N array, where the
ith row is the centroid of code word i. The observation vectors
and centroids have the same feature dimension.

As an example, suppose we wish to compress a 24-bit color image
(each pixel is represented by one byte for red, one for blue, and
one for green) before sending it over the web. By using a smaller
8-bit encoding, we can reduce the amount of data by two
thirds. Ideally, the colors for each of the 256 possible 8-bit
encoding values should be chosen to minimize distortion of the
color. Running k-means with k=256 generates a code book of 256
codes, which fills up all possible 8-bit sequences. Instead of
sending a 3-byte value for each pixel, the 8-bit centroid index
(or code word) of the dominating centroid is transmitted. The code
book is also sent over the wire so each 8-bit code can be
translated back to a 24-bit pixel value representation. If the
image of interest was of an ocean, we would expect many 24-bit
blues to be represented by 8-bit codes. If it was an image of a
human face, more flesh-tone colors would be represented in the
code book.

    Normalize a group of observations on a per feature basis.

    Before running k-means, it is beneficial to rescale each feature
    dimension of the observation set by its standard deviation (i.e. "whiten"
    it - as in "white noise" where each frequency has equal power).
    Each feature is divided by its standard deviation across all observations
    to give it unit variance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obs : ndarray
        Each row of the array is an observation.  The
        columns are the features seen during each observation.

    Performs k-means on a set of observation vectors forming k clusters.

    The k-means algorithm adjusts the classification of the observations
    into clusters and updates the cluster centroids until the position of
    the centroids is stable over successive iterations. In this
    implementation of the algorithm, the stability of the centroids is
    determined by comparing the absolute value of the change in the average
    Euclidean distance between the observations and their corresponding
    centroids against a threshold. This yields
    a code book mapping centroids to codes and vice versa.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obs : ndarray
       Each row of the M by N array is an observation vector. The
       columns are the features seen during each observation.
       The features must be whitened first with the `whiten` function.

    k_or_guess : int or ndarray
       The number of centroids to generate. A code is assigned to
       each centroid, which is also the row index of the centroid
       in the code_book matrix generated.

       The initial k centroids are chosen by randomly selecting
       observations from the observation matrix. Alternatively,
       passing a k by N array specifies the initial k centroids.

    iter : int, optional
       The number of times to run k-means, returning the codebook
       with the lowest distortion. This argument is ignored if
       initial centroids are specified with an array for the
       ``k_or_guess`` parameter. This parameter does not represent the
       number of iterations of the k-means algorithm.

    thresh : float, optional
       Terminates the k-means algorithm if the change in
       distortion since the last k-means iteration is less than
       or equal to threshold.

    check_finite : bool, optional
        Whether to check that the input matrices contain only finite numbers.
        Disabling may give a performance gain, but may result in problems
        (crashes, non-termination) if the inputs do contain infinities or NaNs.
        Default: True

    seed : {None, int, `numpy.random.Generator`, `numpy.random.RandomState`}, optional
        Seed for initializing the pseudo-random number generator.
        If `seed` is None (or `numpy.random`), the `numpy.random.RandomState`
        singleton is used.
        If `seed` is an int, a new ``RandomState`` instance is used,
        seeded with `seed`.
        If `seed` is already a ``Generator`` or ``RandomState`` instance then
        that instance is used.
        The default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    codebook : ndarray
       A k by N array of k centroids. The ith centroid
       codebook[i] is represented with the code i. The centroids
       and codes generated represent the lowest distortion seen,
       not necessarily the globally minimal distortion.
       Note that the number of centroids is not necessarily the same as the
       ``k_or_guess`` parameter, because centroids assigned to no observations
       are removed during iterations.

    distortion : float
       The mean (non-squared) Euclidean distance between the observations
       passed and the centroids generated. Note the difference to the standard
       definition of distortion in the context of the k-means algorithm, which
       is the sum of the squared distances.

        Number of samples to generate.
    rng : `numpy.random.Generator` or `numpy.random.RandomState`
        Random number generator.

    """
    Classify a set of observations into k clusters using the k-means algorithm.

    The algorithm attempts to minimize the Euclidean distance between
    observations and centroids. Several initialization methods are
    included.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray
        A 'M' by 'N' array of 'M' observations in 'N' dimensions or a length
        'M' array of 'M' 1-D observations.
    k : int or ndarray
        The number of clusters to form as well as the number of
        centroids to generate. If `minit` initialization string is
        'matrix', or if a ndarray is given instead, it is
        interpreted as initial cluster to use instead.
    iter : int, optional
        Number of iterations of the k-means algorithm to run. Note
        that this differs in meaning from the iters parameter to
        the kmeans function.
    thresh : float, optional
        (not used yet)
    minit : str, optional
        Method for initialization. Available methods are 'random',
        'points', '++' and 'matrix':

        'random': generate k centroids from a Gaussian with mean and
        variance estimated from the data.

        'points': choose k observations (rows) at random from data for
        the initial centroids.

        '++': choose k observations accordingly to the kmeans++ method
        (careful seeding)

        'matrix': interpret the k parameter as a k by M (or length k
        array for 1-D data) array of initial centroids.
    missing : str, optional
        Method to deal with empty clusters. Available methods are
        'warn' and 'raise':

        'warn': give a warning and continue.

        'raise': raise an ClusterError and terminate the algorithm.
    check_finite : bool, optional
        Whether to check that the input matrices contain only finite numbers.
        Disabling may give a performance gain, but may result in problems
        (crashes, non-termination) if the inputs do contain infinities or NaNs.
        Default: True
    seed : {None, int, `numpy.random.Generator`, `numpy.random.RandomState`}, optional
        Seed for initializing the pseudo-random number generator.
        If `seed` is None (or `numpy.random`), the `numpy.random.RandomState`
        singleton is used.
        If `seed` is an int, a new ``RandomState`` instance is used,
        seeded with `seed`.
        If `seed` is already a ``Generator`` or ``RandomState`` instance then
        that instance is used.
        The default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    centroid : ndarray
        A 'k' by 'N' array of centroids found at the last iteration of
        k-means.
    label : ndarray
        label[i] is the code or index of the centroid the
        ith observation is closest to.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from scipy.cluster.vq import kmeans2
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> import numpy as np

    Create z, an array with shape (100, 2) containing a mixture of samples
    from three multivariate normal distributions.

    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> a = rng.multivariate_normal([0, 6], [[2, 1], [1, 1.5]], size=45)
    >>> b = rng.multivariate_normal([2, 0], [[1, -1], [-1, 3]], size=30)
    >>> c = rng.multivariate_normal([6, 4], [[5, 0], [0, 1.2]], size=25)
    >>> z = np.concatenate((a, b, c))
    >>> rng.shuffle(z)

    Compute three clusters.

    >>> centroid, label = kmeans2(z, 3, minit='points')
    >>> centroid
    array([[ 2.22274463, -0.61666946],  # may vary
           [ 0.54069047,  5.86541444],
           [ 6.73846769,  4.01991898]])

    How many points are in each cluster?

    >>> counts = np.bincount(label)
    >>> counts
    array([29, 51, 20])  # may vary

    Plot the clusters.

    >>> w0 = z[label == 0]
    >>> w1 = z[label == 1]
    >>> w2 = z[label == 2]
    >>> plt.plot(w0[:, 0], w0[:, 1], 'o', alpha=0.5, label='cluster 0')
