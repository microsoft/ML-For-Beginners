    """kd-tree for quick nearest-neighbor lookup.

    This class provides an index into a set of k-dimensional points
    which can be used to rapidly look up the nearest neighbors of any
    point.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array_like, shape (n,m)
        The n data points of dimension m to be indexed. This array is
        not copied unless this is necessary to produce a contiguous
        array of doubles, and so modifying this data will result in
        bogus results. The data are also copied if the kd-tree is built
        with copy_data=True.
    leafsize : positive int, optional
        The number of points at which the algorithm switches over to
        brute-force.  Default: 10.
    compact_nodes : bool, optional
        If True, the kd-tree is built to shrink the hyperrectangles to
        the actual data range. This usually gives a more compact tree that
        is robust against degenerated input data and gives faster queries
        at the expense of longer build time. Default: True.
    copy_data : bool, optional
        If True the data is always copied to protect the kd-tree against
        data corruption. Default: False.
    balanced_tree : bool, optional
        If True, the median is used to split the hyperrectangles instead of
        the midpoint. This usually gives a more compact tree and
        faster queries at the expense of longer build time. Default: True.
    boxsize : array_like or scalar, optional
        Apply a m-d toroidal topology to the KDTree.. The topology is generated
        by :math:`x_i + n_i L_i` where :math:`n_i` are integers and :math:`L_i`
        is the boxsize along i-th dimension. The input data shall be wrapped
        into :math:`[0, L_i)`. A ValueError is raised if any of the data is
        outside of this bound.

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm used is described in Maneewongvatana and Mount 1999.
    The general idea is that the kd-tree is a binary tree, each of whose
    nodes represents an axis-aligned hyperrectangle. Each node specifies
    an axis and splits the set of points based on whether their coordinate
    along that axis is greater than or less than a particular value.

    During construction, the axis and splitting point are chosen by the
    "sliding midpoint" rule, which ensures that the cells do not all
    become long and thin.

    The tree can be queried for the r closest neighbors of any given point
    (optionally returning only those within some maximum distance of the
    point). It can also be queried, with a substantial gain in efficiency,
    for the r approximate closest neighbors.

    For large dimensions (20 is already large) do not expect this to run
    significantly faster than brute force. High-dimensional nearest-neighbor
    queries are a substantial open problem in computer science.

    Attributes
    ----------
    data : ndarray, shape (n,m)
        The n data points of dimension m to be indexed. This array is
        not copied unless this is necessary to produce a contiguous
        array of doubles. The data are also copied if the kd-tree is built
        with `copy_data=True`.
    leafsize : positive int
        The number of points at which the algorithm switches over to
        brute-force.
    m : int
        The dimension of a single data-point.
    n : int
        The number of data points.
    maxes : ndarray, shape (m,)
        The maximum value in each dimension of the n data points.
    mins : ndarray, shape (m,)
        The minimum value in each dimension of the n data points.
    size : int
        The number of nodes in the tree.

        i : integer or array of integers

        Data points on ``self`` and ``other`` are optionally weighted by the

        This is adapted from the "two-point correlation" algorithm described by
        Gray and Moore [1]_.  See notes for further discussion.

        Parameters
        ----------
        other : KDTree
            The other tree to draw points from, can be the same tree as self.
        r : float or one-dimensional array of floats
            The radius to produce a count for. Multiple radii are searched with
            a single tree traversal.
            If the count is non-cumulative(``cumulative=False``), ``r`` defines
            the edges of the bins, and must be non-decreasing.
        p : float, optional
            1<=p<=infinity.
            Which Minkowski p-norm to use.
            Default 2.0.
            A finite large p may cause a ValueError if overflow can occur.
        weights : tuple, array_like, or None, optional
            If None, the pair-counting is unweighted.
            If given as a tuple, weights[0] is the weights of points in
            ``self``, and weights[1] is the weights of points in ``other``;
            either can be None to indicate the points are unweighted.
            If given as an array_like, weights is the weights of points in
            ``self`` and ``other``. For this to make sense, ``self`` and
            ``other`` must be the same tree. If ``self`` and ``other`` are two
            different trees, a ``ValueError`` is raised.
            Default: None

            .. versionadded:: 1.6.0
        cumulative : bool, optional
            Whether the returned counts are cumulative. When cumulative is set
            to ``False`` the algorithm is optimized to work with a large number
            of bins (>10) specified by ``r``. When ``cumulative`` is set to
            True, the algorithm is optimized to work with a small number of
            ``r``. Default: True

            .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

        Returns
        -------
        result : scalar or 1-D array
            The number of pairs. For unweighted counts, the result is integer.
            For weighted counts, the result is float.
            If cumulative is False, ``result[i]`` contains the counts with
            ``(-inf if i == 0 else r[i-1]) < R <= r[i]``

        Notes
        -----
        Pair-counting is the basic operation used to calculate the two point
        correlation functions from a data set composed of position of objects.

        Two point correlation function measures the clustering of objects and
        is widely used in cosmology to quantify the large scale structure
        in our Universe, but it may be useful for data analysis in other fields
        where self-similar assembly of objects also occur.

        The Landy-Szalay estimator for the two point correlation function of
        ``D`` measures the clustering signal in ``D``. [2]_

        For example, given the position of two sets of objects,

        - objects ``D`` (data) contains the clustering signal, and

        - objects ``R`` (random) that contains no signal,

        .. math::

             \\xi(r) = \\frac{<D, D> - 2 f <D, R> + f^2<R, R>}{f^2<R, R>},

        where the brackets represents counting pairs between two data sets
        in a finite bin around ``r`` (distance), corresponding to setting
        `cumulative=False`, and ``f = float(len(D)) / float(len(R))`` is the
        ratio between number of objects from data and random.

        The algorithm implemented here is loosely based on the dual-tree
        algorithm described in [1]_. We switch between two different
        pair-cumulation scheme depending on the setting of ``cumulative``.
        The computing time of the method we use when for
        ``cumulative == False`` does not scale with the total number of bins.
        The algorithm for ``cumulative == True`` scales linearly with the
        number of bins, though it is slightly faster when only
        1 or 2 bins are used. [5]_.

        As an extension to the naive pair-counting,
        weighted pair-counting counts the product of weights instead
        of number of pairs.
        Weighted pair-counting is used to estimate marked correlation functions
        ([3]_, section 2.2),
        or to properly calculate the average of data per distance bin
        (e.g. [4]_, section 2.1 on redshift).
