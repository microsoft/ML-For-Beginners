    This function uses `argrelextrema` with np.less as comparator. Therefore, it

    Calculate the prominence of each peak in a signal.

    The prominence of a peak measures how much a peak stands out from the
    surrounding baseline of the signal and is defined as the vertical distance
    between the peak and its lowest contour line.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : sequence
        A signal with peaks.
    peaks : sequence
        Indices of peaks in `x`.
    wlen : int, optional
        A window length in samples that optionally limits the evaluated area for
        each peak to a subset of `x`. The peak is always placed in the middle of
        the window therefore the given length is rounded up to the next odd
        integer. This parameter can speed up the calculation (see Notes).

    Returns
    -------
    prominences : ndarray
        The calculated prominences for each peak in `peaks`.
    left_bases, right_bases : ndarray
        The peaks' bases as indices in `x` to the left and right of each peak.
        The higher base of each pair is a peak's lowest contour line.

    Raises
    ------

    avoid this, NaNs should either be removed or replaced.

    --------
    find_peaks
        Find peaks inside a signal based on peak properties.
    peak_widths
        Calculate the width of peaks.

    Notes
    -----
    Strategy to compute a peak's prominence:

    1. Extend a horizontal line from the current peak to the left and right
       until the line either reaches the window border (see `wlen`) or
       intersects the signal again at the slope of a higher peak. An
       intersection with a peak of the same height is ignored.
    2. On each side find the minimal signal value within the interval defined
       above. These points are the peak's bases.
    3. The higher one of the two bases marks the peak's lowest contour line. The
       prominence can then be calculated as the vertical difference between the
       peaks height itself and its lowest contour line.

    Searching for the peak's bases can be slow for large `x` with periodic
    behavior because large chunks or even the full signal need to be evaluated
    for the first algorithmic step. This evaluation area can be limited with the
    parameter `wlen` which restricts the algorithm to a window around the
    current peak and can shorten the calculation time if the window length is
    short in relation to `x`.
    However, this may stop the algorithm from finding the true global contour
    line if the peak's true bases are outside this window. Instead, a higher
    contour line is found within the restricted window leading to a smaller
    calculated prominence. In practice, this is only relevant for the highest set
    of peaks in `x`. This behavior may even be used intentionally to calculate
    "local" prominences.

    Calculate the height of each peak's contour line and plot the results

    >>> contour_heights = x[peaks] - prominences
    >>> plt.plot(x)
    >>> plt.plot(peaks, x[peaks], "x")
    >>> plt.vlines(x=peaks, ymin=contour_heights, ymax=x[peaks])
    >>> plt.show()

    Let's evaluate a second example that demonstrates several edge cases for
    one peak at index 5.

    >>> x = np.array([0, 1, 0, 3, 1, 3, 0, 4, 0])
    >>> peaks = np.array([5])

    >>> peak_prominences(x, peaks)  # -> (prominences, left_bases, right_bases)
    (array([3.]), array([2]), array([6]))

    Note how the peak at index 3 of the same height is not considered as a
    border while searching for the left base. Instead, two minima at 0 and 2
    are found in which case the one closer to the evaluated peak is always
    chosen. On the right side, however, the base must be placed at 6 because the
    higher peak represents the right border to the evaluated area.

    >>> peak_prominences(x, peaks, wlen=3.1)
    (array([2.]), array([4]), array([6]))

    Here, we restricted the algorithm to a window from 3 to 7 (the length is 5
    samples because `wlen` was rounded up to the next odd integer). Thus, the
    only two candidates in the evaluated area are the two neighboring samples
    and a smaller prominence is calculated.

    peak_prominences
        Calculate the prominence of peaks.

    Notes
    -----
    The basic algorithm to calculate a peak's width is as follows:

    * Calculate the evaluation height :math:`h_{eval}` with the formula
      :math:`h_{eval} = h_{Peak} - P \\cdot R`, where :math:`h_{Peak}` is the
      height of the peak itself, :math:`P` is the peak's prominence and
      :math:`R` a positive ratio specified with the argument `rel_height`.
    * Draw a horizontal line at the evaluation height to both sides, starting at
      the peak's current vertical position until the lines either intersect a
      slope, the signal border or cross the vertical position of the peak's
      base (see `peak_prominences` for an definition). For the first case,
      intersection with the signal, the true intersection point is estimated
      with linear interpolation.
    * Calculate the width as the horizontal distance between the chosen
      endpoints on both sides. As a consequence of this the maximal possible
      width for each peak is the horizontal distance between its bases.

    As shown above to calculate a peak's width its prominence and bases must be
    known. You can supply these yourself with the argument `prominence_data`.
    Otherwise, they are internally calculated (see `peak_prominences`).

    Find peaks inside a signal based on peak properties.

    This function takes a 1-D array and finds all local maxima by
    simple comparison of neighboring values. Optionally, a subset of these
    peaks can be selected by specifying conditions for a peak's properties.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : sequence
        A signal with peaks.
    height : number or ndarray or sequence, optional
        Required height of peaks. Either a number, ``None``, an array matching
        `x` or a 2-element sequence of the former. The first element is
        always interpreted as the  minimal and the second, if supplied, as the
        maximal required height.
    threshold : number or ndarray or sequence, optional
        Required threshold of peaks, the vertical distance to its neighboring
        samples. Either a number, ``None``, an array matching `x` or a
        2-element sequence of the former. The first element is always
        interpreted as the  minimal and the second, if supplied, as the maximal
        required threshold.
    distance : number, optional
        Required minimal horizontal distance (>= 1) in samples between
        neighbouring peaks. Smaller peaks are removed first until the condition
        is fulfilled for all remaining peaks.
    prominence : number or ndarray or sequence, optional
        Required prominence of peaks. Either a number, ``None``, an array
        matching `x` or a 2-element sequence of the former. The first
        element is always interpreted as the  minimal and the second, if
        supplied, as the maximal required prominence.
    width : number or ndarray or sequence, optional
        Required width of peaks in samples. Either a number, ``None``, an array
        matching `x` or a 2-element sequence of the former. The first
        element is always interpreted as the  minimal and the second, if
        supplied, as the maximal required width.
    wlen : int, optional
        Used for calculation of the peaks prominences, thus it is only used if
        one of the arguments `prominence` or `width` is given. See argument
        `wlen` in `peak_prominences` for a full description of its effects.
    rel_height : float, optional
        Used for calculation of the peaks width, thus it is only used if `width`
        is given. See argument  `rel_height` in `peak_widths` for a full
        description of its effects.
    plateau_size : number or ndarray or sequence, optional
        Required size of the flat top of peaks in samples. Either a number,
        ``None``, an array matching `x` or a 2-element sequence of the former.
        The first element is always interpreted as the minimal and the second,
        if supplied as the maximal required plateau size.

    Returns
    -------
    peaks : ndarray
        Indices of peaks in `x` that satisfy all given conditions.
    properties : dict
        A dictionary containing properties of the returned peaks which were
        calculated as intermediate results during evaluation of the specified
        conditions:

        * 'peak_heights'
              If `height` is given, the height of each peak in `x`.
        * 'left_thresholds', 'right_thresholds'
              If `threshold` is given, these keys contain a peaks vertical
              distance to its neighbouring samples.
        * 'prominences', 'right_bases', 'left_bases'
              If `prominence` is given, these keys are accessible. See
              `peak_prominences` for a description of their content.
        * 'width_heights', 'left_ips', 'right_ips'
              If `width` is given, these keys are accessible. See `peak_widths`
              for a description of their content.
        * 'plateau_sizes', left_edges', 'right_edges'
              If `plateau_size` is given, these keys are accessible and contain
              the indices of a peak's edges (edges are still part of the
              plateau) and the calculated plateau sizes.

              .. versionadded:: 1.2.0

        To calculate and return properties without excluding peaks, provide the
        open interval ``(None, None)`` as a value to the appropriate argument
        (excluding `distance`).

    Warns
    -----
    PeakPropertyWarning
        Raised if a peak's properties have unexpected values (see
        `peak_prominences` and `peak_widths`).

    Warnings
    --------
    This function may return unexpected results for data containing NaNs. To
    avoid this, NaNs should either be removed or replaced.

    See Also
    --------
    find_peaks_cwt
        Find peaks using the wavelet transformation.
    peak_prominences
        Directly calculate the prominence of peaks.
    peak_widths
        Directly calculate the width of peaks.

    Notes
    -----
    In the context of this function, a peak or local maximum is defined as any
    sample whose two direct neighbours have a smaller amplitude. For flat peaks
    (more than one sample of equal amplitude wide) the index of the middle
    sample is returned (rounded down in case the number of samples is even).
    For noisy signals the peak locations can be off because the noise might
    change the position of local maxima. In those cases consider smoothing the
    signal before searching for peaks or use other peak finding and fitting
    methods (like `find_peaks_cwt`).

    Some additional comments on specifying conditions:

    * Almost all conditions (excluding `distance`) can be given as half-open or
      closed intervals, e.g., ``1`` or ``(1, None)`` defines the half-open
      interval :math:`[1, \\infty]` while ``(None, 1)`` defines the interval
      :math:`[-\\infty, 1]`. The open interval ``(None, None)`` can be specified
      as well, which returns the matching properties without exclusion of peaks.
    * The border is always included in the interval used to select valid peaks.
    * For several conditions the interval borders can be specified with
      arrays matching `x` in shape which enables dynamic constrains based on
      the sample position.
    * The conditions are evaluated in the following order: `plateau_size`,
      `height`, `threshold`, `distance`, `prominence`, `width`. In most cases
      this order is the fastest one because faster operations are applied first
      to reduce the number of peaks that need to be evaluated later.
    * While indices in `peaks` are guaranteed to be at least `distance` samples
      apart, edges of flat peaks may be closer than the allowed `distance`.
    * Use `wlen` to reduce the time it takes to evaluate the conditions for
      `prominence` or `width` if `x` is large or has many local maxima
      (see `peak_prominences`).

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Examples
    --------
    To demonstrate this function's usage we use a signal `x` supplied with
    SciPy (see `scipy.datasets.electrocardiogram`). Let's find all peaks (local
    maxima) in `x` whose amplitude lies above 0.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> from scipy.datasets import electrocardiogram
    >>> from scipy.signal import find_peaks
    >>> x = electrocardiogram()[2000:4000]
    >>> peaks, _ = find_peaks(x, height=0)
    >>> plt.plot(x)
    >>> plt.plot(peaks, x[peaks], "x")
    >>> plt.plot(np.zeros_like(x), "--", color="gray")
    >>> plt.show()

    We can select peaks below 0 with ``height=(None, 0)`` or use arrays matching
    `x` in size to reflect a changing condition for different parts of the
    signal.

    >>> border = np.sin(np.linspace(0, 3 * np.pi, x.size))
    >>> peaks, _ = find_peaks(x, height=(-border, border))
    >>> plt.plot(x)
    >>> plt.plot(-border, "--", color="gray")
    >>> plt.plot(border, ":", color="gray")
    >>> plt.plot(peaks, x[peaks], "x")
    >>> plt.show()

    Another useful condition for periodic signals can be given with the
    `distance` argument. In this case, we can easily select the positions of
    QRS complexes within the electrocardiogram (ECG) by demanding a distance of
    at least 150 samples.

    >>> peaks, _ = find_peaks(x, distance=150)
    >>> np.diff(peaks)
    array([186, 180, 177, 171, 177, 169, 167, 164, 158, 162, 172])
    >>> plt.plot(x)
    >>> plt.plot(peaks, x[peaks], "x")
    >>> plt.show()

    Especially for noisy signals peaks can be easily grouped by their
    prominence (see `peak_prominences`). E.g., we can select all peaks except
    for the mentioned QRS complexes by limiting the allowed prominence to 0.6.

    >>> peaks, properties = find_peaks(x, prominence=(None, 0.6))
    >>> properties["prominences"].max()
    0.5049999999999999
    >>> plt.plot(x)
    >>> plt.plot(peaks, x[peaks], "x")
    >>> plt.show()

    And, finally, let's examine a different section of the ECG which contains
    beat forms of different shape. To select only the atypical heart beats, we
    combine two conditions: a minimal prominence of 1 and width of at least 20
    samples.

    >>> x = electrocardiogram()[17000:18000]
    >>> peaks, properties = find_peaks(x, prominence=1, width=20)
    >>> properties["prominences"], properties["widths"]
    (array([1.495, 2.3  ]), array([36.93773946, 39.32723577]))
    >>> plt.plot(x)
    >>> plt.plot(peaks, x[peaks], "x")
    >>> plt.vlines(x=peaks, ymin=x[peaks] - properties["prominences"],
    ...            ymax = x[peaks], color = "C1")
    >>> plt.hlines(y=properties["width_heights"], xmin=properties["left_ips"],
    ...            xmax=properties["right_ips"], color = "C1")
    >>> plt.show()

    """
    Find peaks in a 1-D array with wavelet transformation.

    The general approach is to smooth `vector` by convolving it with
    `wavelet(width)` for each width in `widths`. Relative maxima which
    appear at enough length scales, and with sufficiently high SNR, are
    accepted.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vector : ndarray
        1-D array in which to find the peaks.
    widths : float or sequence
        Single width or 1-D array-like of widths to use for calculating
        the CWT matrix. In general,
        this range should cover the expected width of peaks of interest.
    wavelet : callable, optional
        Should take two parameters and return a 1-D array to convolve
        with `vector`. The first parameter determines the number of points
        of the returned wavelet array, the second parameter is the scale
        (`width`) of the wavelet. Should be normalized and symmetric.
        Default is the ricker wavelet.
    max_distances : ndarray, optional
        At each row, a ridge line is only connected if the relative max at
        row[n] is within ``max_distances[n]`` from the relative max at
        ``row[n+1]``.  Default value is ``widths/4``.
    gap_thresh : float, optional
        If a relative maximum is not found within `max_distances`,
        there will be a gap. A ridge line is discontinued if there are more
        than `gap_thresh` points without connecting a new relative maximum.
        Default is the first value of the widths array i.e. widths[0].
    min_length : int, optional
        Minimum length a ridge line needs to be acceptable.
        Default is ``cwt.shape[0] / 4``, ie 1/4-th the number of widths.
    min_snr : float, optional
        Minimum SNR ratio. Default 1. The signal is the maximum CWT coefficient
        on the largest ridge line. The noise is `noise_perc` th percentile of
        datapoints contained within the same ridge line.
    noise_perc : float, optional
        When calculating the noise floor, percentile of data points
        examined below which to consider noise. Calculated using
        `stats.scoreatpercentile`.  Default is 10.
    window_size : int, optional
        Size of window to use to calculate noise floor.
        Default is ``cwt.shape[1] / 20``.

    Returns
    -------
    peaks_indices : ndarray
        Indices of the locations in the `vector` where peaks were found.
        The list is sorted.

    See Also
    --------
    cwt
        Continuous wavelet transform.
    find_peaks
        Find peaks inside a signal based on peak properties.

    Notes
    -----
    This approach was designed for finding sharp peaks among noisy data,
    however with proper parameter selection it should function well for
    different peak shapes.

    The algorithm is as follows:
     1. Perform a continuous wavelet transform on `vector`, for the supplied
        `widths`. This is a convolution of `vector` with `wavelet(width)` for
        each width in `widths`. See `cwt`.
     2. Identify "ridge lines" in the cwt matrix. These are relative maxima
        at each row, connected across adjacent rows. See identify_ridge_lines
     3. Filter the ridge_lines using filter_ridge_lines.
