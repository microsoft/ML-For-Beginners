    b : array_like
        Numerator of a linear filter. If `b` has dimension greater than 1,
        it is assumed that the coefficients are stored in the first dimension,
        and ``b.shape[1:]``, ``a.shape[1:]``, and the shape of the frequencies
        array must be compatible for broadcasting.
    a : array_like
        Denominator of a linear filter. If `b` has dimension greater than 1,
        it is assumed that the coefficients are stored in the first dimension,
        and ``b.shape[1:]``, ``a.shape[1:]``, and the shape of the frequencies
        array must be compatible for broadcasting.
    worN : {None, int, array_like}, optional
        If a single integer, then compute at that many frequencies (default is
        N=512). This is a convenient alternative to::

            np.linspace(0, fs if whole else fs/2, N, endpoint=include_nyquist)

        Using a number that is fast for FFT computations can result in
        faster computations (see Notes).

        If an array_like, compute the response at the frequencies given.
        These are in the same units as `fs`.
    whole : bool, optional
        Normally, frequencies are computed from 0 to the Nyquist frequency,
        fs/2 (upper-half of unit-circle). If `whole` is True, compute
        frequencies from 0 to fs. Ignored if worN is array_like.
    plot : callable
        A callable that takes two arguments. If given, the return parameters
        `w` and `h` are passed to plot. Useful for plotting the frequency
        response inside `freqz`.
    fs : float, optional
        The sampling frequency of the digital system. Defaults to 2*pi
        radians/sample (so w is from 0 to pi).

        .. versionadded:: 1.2.0
    include_nyquist : bool, optional
        If `whole` is False and `worN` is an integer, setting `include_nyquist`
        to True will include the last frequency (Nyquist frequency) and is
        otherwise ignored.

        .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

    Returns
    -------
    w : ndarray
        The frequencies at which `h` was computed, in the same units as `fs`.
        By default, `w` is normalized to the range [0, pi) (radians/sample).
    h : ndarray
        The frequency response, as complex numbers.

    See Also
    --------
    freqz_zpk
    sosfreqz

    Notes
    -----
    Using Matplotlib's :func:`matplotlib.pyplot.plot` function as the callable
    for `plot` produces unexpected results, as this plots the real part of the
    complex transfer function, not the magnitude.
    Try ``lambda w, h: plot(w, np.abs(h))``.

    A direct computation via (R)FFT is used to compute the frequency response
    when the following conditions are met:

    1. An integer value is given for `worN`.
    2. `worN` is fast to compute via FFT (i.e.,
       `next_fast_len(worN) <scipy.fft.next_fast_len>` equals `worN`).
    3. The denominator coefficients are a single value (``a.shape[0] == 1``).
    4. `worN` is at least as long as the numerator coefficients
       (``worN >= b.shape[0]``).
    5. If ``b.ndim > 1``, then ``b.shape[-1] == 1``.

    For long FIR filters, the FFT approach can have lower error and be much
    faster than the equivalent direct polynomial calculation.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from scipy import signal
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> b = signal.firwin(80, 0.5, window=('kaiser', 8))
    >>> w, h = signal.freqz(b)

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    >>> ax1.set_title('Digital filter frequency response')

    >>> ax1.plot(w, 20 * np.log10(abs(h)), 'b')
    >>> ax1.set_ylabel('Amplitude [dB]', color='b')
    >>> ax1.set_xlabel('Frequency [rad/sample]')

    >>> ax2 = ax1.twinx()
    >>> angles = np.unwrap(np.angle(h))
    >>> ax2.plot(w, angles, 'g')
    >>> ax2.set_ylabel('Angle (radians)', color='g')
    >>> ax2.grid(True)
    >>> ax2.axis('tight')
    >>> plt.show()

    Broadcasting Examples

    Suppose we have two FIR filters whose coefficients are stored in the
    rows of an array with shape (2, 25). For this demonstration, we'll
    use random data:

    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> b = rng.random((2, 25))

    To compute the frequency response for these two filters with one call
    to `freqz`, we must pass in ``b.T``, because `freqz` expects the first
    axis to hold the coefficients. We must then extend the shape with a
    trivial dimension of length 1 to allow broadcasting with the array
    of frequencies.  That is, we pass in ``b.T[..., np.newaxis]``, which has
    shape (25, 2, 1):

    >>> w, h = signal.freqz(b.T[..., np.newaxis], worN=1024)
    >>> w.shape
    (1024,)
    >>> h.shape
    (2, 1024)

    Now, suppose we have two transfer functions, with the same numerator
    coefficients ``b = [0.5, 0.5]``. The coefficients for the two denominators
    are stored in the first dimension of the 2-D array  `a`::

        a = [   1      1  ]
            [ -0.25, -0.5 ]

    >>> b = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 1], [-0.25, -0.5]])

    Only `a` is more than 1-D. To make it compatible for
    broadcasting with the frequencies, we extend it with a trivial dimension
    in the call to `freqz`:

    >>> w, h = signal.freqz(b, a[..., np.newaxis], worN=1024)
    >>> w.shape
    (1024,)
    >>> h.shape
    (2, 1024)

def group_delay(system, w=512, whole=False, fs=2*pi):
    r"""Compute the group delay of a digital filter.

    The group delay measures by how many samples amplitude envelopes of
    various spectral components of a signal are delayed by a filter.
    It is formally defined as the derivative of continuous (unwrapped) phase::

               d        jw
     D(w) = - -- arg H(e)
              dw

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : tuple of array_like (b, a)
        Numerator and denominator coefficients of a filter transfer function.
    w : {None, int, array_like}, optional
        If a single integer, then compute at that many frequencies (default is
        N=512).

        If an array_like, compute the delay at the frequencies given. These
        are in the same units as `fs`.
    whole : bool, optional
        Normally, frequencies are computed from 0 to the Nyquist frequency,
        fs/2 (upper-half of unit-circle). If `whole` is True, compute
        frequencies from 0 to fs. Ignored if w is array_like.
    fs : float, optional
        The sampling frequency of the digital system. Defaults to 2*pi
        radians/sample (so w is from 0 to pi).

        .. versionadded:: 1.2.0

    Returns
    -------
    w : ndarray
        The frequencies at which group delay was computed, in the same units
        as `fs`.  By default, `w` is normalized to the range [0, pi)
        (radians/sample).
    gd : ndarray
        The group delay.

    See Also
    --------
    freqz : Frequency response of a digital filter

    Notes
    -----
    The similar function in MATLAB is called `grpdelay`.

    If the transfer function :math:`H(z)` has zeros or poles on the unit
    circle, the group delay at corresponding frequencies is undefined.
    When such a case arises the warning is raised and the group delay
    is set to 0 at those frequencies.

    For the details of numerical computation of the group delay refer to [1]_.

    Compute the frequency response of a digital filter in SOS format.

    Given `sos`, an array with shape (n, 6) of second order sections of
    a digital filter, compute the frequency response of the system function::

               B0(z)   B1(z)         B{n-1}(z)

    denominator of the transfer function of the k-th second order section.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sos : array_like
        Array of second-order filter coefficients, must have shape
        ``(n_sections, 6)``. Each row corresponds to a second-order
        section, with the first three columns providing the numerator

    a : array_like
        Denominator polynomial coefficients.

    Returns

        System gain.

    Notes
    -----
    If some values of `b` are too close to 0, they are removed. In that case,
    a BadCoefficients warning is emitted.

    The `b` and `a` arrays are interpreted as coefficients for positive,
    descending powers of the transfer function variable. So the inputs
    :math:`b = [b_0, b_1, ..., b_M]` and :math:`a =[a_0, a_1, ..., a_N]`
    can represent an analog filter of the form:

    .. math::

        H(s) = \frac
        {b_0 s^M + b_1 s^{(M-1)} + \cdots + b_M}
        {a_0 s^N + a_1 s^{(N-1)} + \cdots + a_N}

    or a discrete-time filter of the form:

    .. math::

        H(z) = \frac
        {b_0 z^M + b_1 z^{(M-1)} + \cdots + b_M}
        {a_0 z^N + a_1 z^{(N-1)} + \cdots + a_N}

    This "positive powers" form is found more commonly in controls
    engineering. If `M` and `N` are equal (which is true for all filters
    generated by the bilinear transform), then this happens to be equivalent
    to the "negative powers" discrete-time form preferred in DSP:

    .. math::

        H(z) = \frac
        {b_0 + b_1 z^{-1} + \cdots + b_M z^{-M}}
        {a_0 + a_1 z^{-1} + \cdots + a_N z^{-N}}

    Although this is true for common filters, remember that this is not true
    in the general case. If `M` and `N` are not equal, the discrete-time
    transfer function coefficients must first be converted to the "positive
    powers" form before finding the poles and zeros.

    sosfilt

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm used to convert ZPK to SOS format is designed to
    minimize errors due to numerical precision issues. The pairing
    algorithm attempts to minimize the peak gain of each biquadratic
    section. This is done by pairing poles with the nearest zeros, starting
    with the poles closest to the unit circle for discrete-time systems, and
    poles closest to the imaginary axis for continuous-time systems.

    ``pairing='minimal'`` outputs may not be suitable for `sosfilt`,
    and ``analog=True`` outputs will never be suitable for `sosfilt`.

    *Algorithms*

    The steps in the ``pairing='nearest'``, ``pairing='keep_odd'``,
    and ``pairing='minimal'`` algorithms are mostly shared. The
    ``'nearest'`` algorithm attempts to minimize the peak gain, while
    ``'keep_odd'`` minimizes peak gain under the constraint that
    odd-order systems should retain one section as first order.
    ``'minimal'`` is similar to ``'keep_odd'``, but no additional
    poles or zeros are introduced

    The algorithm steps are as follows:

    As a pre-processing step for ``pairing='nearest'``,
    ``pairing='keep_odd'``, add poles or zeros to the origin as
    necessary to obtain the same number of poles and zeros for
    pairing.  If ``pairing == 'nearest'`` and there are an odd number
    of poles, add an additional pole and a zero at the origin.

    The following steps are then iterated over until no more poles or
    zeros remain:

    1. Take the (next remaining) pole (complex or real) closest to the
       unit circle (or imaginary axis, for ``analog=True``) to
       begin a new filter section.

    2. If the pole is real and there are no other remaining real poles [#]_,
       add the closest real zero to the section and leave it as a first
       order section. Note that after this step we are guaranteed to be
       left with an even number of real poles, complex poles, real zeros,
       and complex zeros for subsequent pairing iterations.

    3. Else:

        1. If the pole is complex and the zero is the only remaining real
           zero*, then pair the pole with the *next* closest zero
           (guaranteed to be complex). This is necessary to ensure that
           there will be a real zero remaining to eventually create a
           first-order section (thus keeping the odd order).

        2. Else pair the pole with the closest remaining zero (complex or
           real).

        3. Proceed to complete the second-order section by adding another
           pole and zero to the current pole and zero in the section:

            1. If the current pole and zero are both complex, add their
               conjugates.

            2. Else if the pole is complex and the zero is real, add the
               conjugate pole and the next closest real zero.

            3. Else if the pole is real and the zero is complex, add the
               conjugate zero and the real pole closest to those zeros.

            4. Else (we must have a real pole and real zero) add the next
               real pole closest to the unit circle, and then add the real
               zero closest to that pole.

    .. [#] This conditional can only be met for specific odd-order inputs
           with the ``pairing = 'keep_odd'`` or ``'minimal'`` methods.

    Examples
    --------

    Design a 6th order low-pass elliptic digital filter for a system with a
    sampling rate of 8000 Hz that has a pass-band corner frequency of
    1000 Hz. The ripple in the pass-band should not exceed 0.087 dB, and
    the attenuation in the stop-band should be at least 90 dB.

    In the following call to `ellip`, we could use ``output='sos'``,
    but for this example, we'll use ``output='zpk'``, and then convert
    to SOS format with `zpk2sos`:

    >>> from scipy import signal
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> z, p, k = signal.ellip(6, 0.087, 90, 1000/(0.5*8000), output='zpk')

    Now convert to SOS format.

    >>> sos = signal.zpk2sos(z, p, k)

    The coefficients of the numerators of the sections:

    >>> sos[:, :3]
    array([[0.0014152 , 0.00248677, 0.0014152 ],
           [1.        , 0.72976874, 1.        ],
           [1.        , 0.17607852, 1.        ]])

    The symmetry in the coefficients occurs because all the zeros are on the
    unit circle.

    The coefficients of the denominators of the sections:

    >>> sos[:, 3:]
    array([[ 1.        , -1.32544025,  0.46989976],
           [ 1.        , -1.26118294,  0.62625924],
           [ 1.        , -1.2570723 ,  0.8619958 ]])

    The next example shows the effect of the `pairing` option.  We have a
    system with three poles and three zeros, so the SOS array will have
    shape (2, 6). The means there is, in effect, an extra pole and an extra
    zero at the origin in the SOS representation.

    >>> z1 = np.array([-1, -0.5-0.5j, -0.5+0.5j])
    >>> p1 = np.array([0.75, 0.8+0.1j, 0.8-0.1j])

    With ``pairing='nearest'`` (the default), we obtain

    >>> signal.zpk2sos(z1, p1, 1)
    array([[ 1.  ,  1.  ,  0.5 ,  1.  , -0.75,  0.  ],
           [ 1.  ,  1.  ,  0.  ,  1.  , -1.6 ,  0.65]])

    The first section has the zeros {-0.5-0.05j, -0.5+0.5j} and the poles
    {0, 0.75}, and the second section has the zeros {-1, 0} and poles
    {0.8+0.1j, 0.8-0.1j}. Note that the extra pole and zero at the origin
    have been assigned to different sections.

    With ``pairing='keep_odd'``, we obtain:

    >>> signal.zpk2sos(z1, p1, 1, pairing='keep_odd')
    array([[ 1.  ,  1.  ,  0.  ,  1.  , -0.75,  0.  ],
           [ 1.  ,  1.  ,  0.5 ,  1.  , -1.6 ,  0.65]])

    The extra pole and zero at the origin are in the same section.
    The first section is, in effect, a first-order section.

    With ``pairing='minimal'``, the first-order section doesn't have
    the extra pole and zero at the origin:

    >>> signal.zpk2sos(z1, p1, 1, pairing='minimal')
    array([[ 0.  ,  1.  ,  1.  ,  0.  ,  1.  , -0.75],
           [ 1.  ,  1.  ,  0.5 ,  1.  , -1.6 ,  0.65]])

    If values of `b` are too close to 0, they are removed. In that case, a
    BadCoefficients warning is emitted.

    Parameters
    ----------
    b: array_like
        Numerator of the transfer function. Can be a 2-D array to normalize
        multiple transfer functions.
    a: array_like
        Denominator of the transfer function. At most 1-D.

    Returns
    -------
    num: array
        The numerator of the normalized transfer function. At least a 1-D
        array. A 2-D array if the input `num` is a 2-D array.
    den: 1-D array
        The denominator of the normalized transfer function.

    Notes
    -----
    Coefficients for both the numerator and denominator should be specified in
    descending exponent order (e.g., ``s^2 + 3s + 5`` would be represented as
    ``[1, 3, 5]``).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from scipy.signal import normalize

    Normalize the coefficients of the transfer function
    ``(3*s^2 - 2*s + 5) / (2*s^2 + 3*s + 1)``:

    >>> b = [3, -2, 5]
    >>> a = [2, 3, 1]
    >>> normalize(b, a)
    (array([ 1.5, -1. ,  2.5]), array([1. , 1.5, 0.5]))

    A warning is generated if, for example, the first coefficient of
    `b` is 0.  In the following example, the result is as expected:

    Given passband and stopband frequencies and gains, construct an analog or
    digital IIR filter of minimum order for a given basic type. Return the
    output in numerator, denominator ('ba'), pole-zero ('zpk') or second order
    sections ('sos') form.

    Parameters
    ----------
    wp, ws : float or array like, shape (2,)
        Passband and stopband edge frequencies. Possible values are scalars
        (for lowpass and highpass filters) or ranges (for bandpass and bandstop
        filters).
        For digital filters, these are in the same units as `fs`. By default,
        `fs` is 2 half-cycles/sample, so these are normalized from 0 to 1,
        where 1 is the Nyquist frequency. For example:

            - Lowpass:   wp = 0.2,          ws = 0.3
            - Highpass:  wp = 0.3,          ws = 0.2
            - Bandpass:  wp = [0.2, 0.5],   ws = [0.1, 0.6]
            - Bandstop:  wp = [0.1, 0.6],   ws = [0.2, 0.5]

        For analog filters, `wp` and `ws` are angular frequencies (e.g., rad/s).
        Note, that for bandpass and bandstop filters passband must lie strictly
        inside stopband or vice versa.
    gpass : float
        The maximum loss in the passband (dB).
    gstop : float
        The minimum attenuation in the stopband (dB).
    analog : bool, optional
        When True, return an analog filter, otherwise a digital filter is
        returned.
    ftype : str, optional
        The type of IIR filter to design:

            - Butterworth   : 'butter'
            - Chebyshev I   : 'cheby1'
            - Chebyshev II  : 'cheby2'
            - Cauer/elliptic: 'ellip'

    output : {'ba', 'zpk', 'sos'}, optional
        Filter form of the output:

            - second-order sections (recommended): 'sos'
            - numerator/denominator (default)    : 'ba'
            - pole-zero                          : 'zpk'

        In general the second-order sections ('sos') form  is
        recommended because inferring the coefficients for the
        numerator/denominator form ('ba') suffers from numerical
        instabilities. For reasons of backward compatibility the default
        form is the numerator/denominator form ('ba'), where the 'b'
        and the 'a' in 'ba' refer to the commonly used names of the
        coefficients used.

        Note: Using the second-order sections form ('sos') is sometimes
        associated with additional computational costs: for
        data-intense use cases it is therefore recommended to also
        investigate the numerator/denominator form ('ba').

    fs : float, optional
        The sampling frequency of the digital system.

        The order of the filter.
    Wn : array_like
        A scalar or length-2 sequence giving the critical frequencies.

        For digital filters, `Wn` are in the same units as `fs`. By default,

        where 1 is the Nyquist frequency. (`Wn` is thus in
        half-cycles / sample.)

    Butterworth digital and analog filter design.

    Design an Nth-order digital or analog Butterworth filter and return
    the filter coefficients.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : int
        The order of the filter. For 'bandpass' and 'bandstop' filters,
        the resulting order of the final second-order sections ('sos')
        matrix is ``2*N``, with `N` the number of biquad sections
        of the desired system.
    Wn : array_like
        The critical frequency or frequencies. For lowpass and highpass
        filters, Wn is a scalar; for bandpass and bandstop filters,
        Wn is a length-2 sequence.

        For a Butterworth filter, this is the point at which the gain
        drops to 1/sqrt(2) that of the passband (the "-3 dB point").

        For digital filters, if `fs` is not specified, `Wn` units are
        normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 is the Nyquist frequency (`Wn` is
        thus in half cycles / sample and defined as 2*critical frequencies
        / `fs`). If `fs` is specified, `Wn` is in the same units as `fs`.

        For analog filters, `Wn` is an angular frequency (e.g. rad/s).
    btype : {'lowpass', 'highpass', 'bandpass', 'bandstop'}, optional
        The type of filter.  Default is 'lowpass'.
    analog : bool, optional
        When True, return an analog filter, otherwise a digital filter is
        returned.
    output : {'ba', 'zpk', 'sos'}, optional
        Type of output:  numerator/denominator ('ba'), pole-zero ('zpk'), or
        second-order sections ('sos'). Default is 'ba' for backwards
        compatibility, but 'sos' should be used for general-purpose filtering.
    fs : float, optional
        The sampling frequency of the digital system.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2.0

    Returns
    -------
    b, a : ndarray, ndarray
        Numerator (`b`) and denominator (`a`) polynomials of the IIR filter.
        Only returned if ``output='ba'``.
    z, p, k : ndarray, ndarray, float
        Zeros, poles, and system gain of the IIR filter transfer
        function.  Only returned if ``output='zpk'``.

    Notes
    -----
    The Butterworth filter has maximally flat frequency response in the
    passband.

    The ``'sos'`` output parameter was added in 0.16.0.

    If the transfer function form ``[b, a]`` is requested, numerical
    problems can occur since the conversion between roots and
    the polynomial coefficients is a numerically sensitive operation,
    even for N >= 4. It is recommended to work with the SOS
    representation.

    .. warning::
        Designing high-order and narrowband IIR filters in TF form can
        result in unstable or incorrect filtering due to floating point
        numerical precision issues. Consider inspecting output filter
        characteristics `freqz` or designing the filters with second-order
        sections via ``output='sos'``.

    Notes
    -----
    The Chebyshev type I filter maximizes the rate of cutoff between the
    frequency response's passband and stopband, at the expense of ripple in
    the passband and increased ringing in the step response.

    Type I filters roll off faster than Type II (`cheby2`), but Type II
    filters do not have any ripple in the passband.

    The equiripple passband has N maxima or minima (for example, a
    5th-order filter has 3 maxima and 2 minima). Consequently, the DC gain is
    unity for odd-order filters, or -rp dB for even-order filters.

    Notes
    -----
    Also known as Cauer or Zolotarev filters, the elliptical filter maximizes
    the rate of transition between the frequency response's passband and
    stopband, at the expense of ripple in both, and increased ringing in the
    step response.

    As `rp` approaches 0, the elliptical filter becomes a Chebyshev
    type II filter (`cheby2`). As `rs` approaches 0, it becomes a Chebyshev
    type I filter (`cheby1`). As both approach 0, it becomes a Butterworth
    filter (`butter`).

    The equiripple passband has N maxima or minima (for example, a
    5th-order filter has 3 maxima and 2 minima). Consequently, the DC gain is
    unity for odd-order filters, or -rp dB for even-order filters.

    The ``'sos'`` output parameter was added in 0.16.0.

    Examples
    --------
    Design an analog filter and plot its frequency response, showing the
    critical points:

    >>> import numpy as np

    >>> b, a = signal.ellip(4, 5, 40, 100, 'low', analog=True)
    >>> w, h = signal.freqs(b, a)
    >>> plt.semilogx(w, 20 * np.log10(abs(h)))
    >>> plt.title('Elliptic filter frequency response (rp=5, rs=40)')
    >>> plt.xlabel('Frequency [radians / second]')
    >>> plt.ylabel('Amplitude [dB]')
    >>> plt.margins(0, 0.1)
    >>> plt.grid(which='both', axis='both')
    >>> plt.axvline(100, color='green') # cutoff frequency
    >>> plt.axhline(-40, color='green') # rs
    >>> plt.axhline(-5, color='green') # rp
    >>> plt.show()

    Generate a signal made up of 10 Hz and 20 Hz, sampled at 1 kHz

    >>> t = np.linspace(0, 1, 1000, False)  # 1 second
    >>> sig = np.sin(2*np.pi*10*t) + np.sin(2*np.pi*20*t)
    >>> fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2, 1, sharex=True)
    >>> ax1.plot(t, sig)
    >>> ax1.set_title('10 Hz and 20 Hz sinusoids')
    >>> ax1.axis([0, 1, -2, 2])

    Design a digital high-pass filter at 17 Hz to remove the 10 Hz tone, and
    apply it to the signal. (It's recommended to use second-order sections
    format when filtering, to avoid numerical error with transfer function
    (``ba``) format):

    >>> sos = signal.ellip(8, 1, 100, 17, 'hp', fs=1000, output='sos')
    >>> filtered = signal.sosfilt(sos, sig)

    Bessel/Thomson digital and analog filter design.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : int
        The order of the filter.
    Wn : array_like
        A scalar or length-2 sequence giving the critical frequencies (defined
        by the `norm` parameter).
        For analog filters, `Wn` is an angular frequency (e.g., rad/s).

        For digital filters, `Wn` are in the same units as `fs`.  By default,
        `fs` is 2 half-cycles/sample, so these are normalized from 0 to 1,
        where 1 is the Nyquist frequency. (`Wn` is thus in
        half-cycles / sample.)

    output : {'ba', 'zpk', 'sos'}, optional
        Type of output:  numerator/denominator ('ba'), pole-zero ('zpk'), or
        second-order sections ('sos'). Default is 'ba'.
    norm : {'phase', 'delay', 'mag'}, optional
        Critical frequency normalization:

        ``phase``
            The filter is normalized such that the phase response reaches its
            midpoint at angular (e.g. rad/s) frequency `Wn`. This happens for
            both low-pass and high-pass filters, so this is the
            "phase-matched" case.

            The magnitude response asymptotes are the same as a Butterworth
            filter of the same order with a cutoff of `Wn`.

            This is the default, and matches MATLAB's implementation.

        ``delay``
            The filter is normalized such that the group delay in the passband
            is 1/`Wn` (e.g., seconds). This is the "natural" type obtained by
            solving Bessel polynomials.

        ``mag``
            The filter is normalized such that the gain magnitude is -3 dB at
            angular frequency `Wn`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.18.0
    fs : float, optional
        The sampling frequency of the digital system.

    b, a : ndarray, ndarray

        Second-order sections representation of the IIR filter.
        Only returned if ``output='sos'``.

    Notes
    -----
    Also known as a Thomson filter, the analog Bessel filter has maximally
    flat group delay and maximally linear phase response, with very little
    ringing in the step response. [1]_

    The Bessel is inherently an analog filter. This function generates digital
    Bessel filters using the bilinear transform, which does not preserve the
    phase response of the analog filter. As such, it is only approximately
    correct at frequencies below about fs/4. To get maximally-flat group
    delay at higher frequencies, the analog Bessel filter must be transformed
    using phase-preserving techniques.

    See `besselap` for implementation details and references.

    The ``'sos'`` output parameter was added in 0.16.0.

    wp, ws : float
        Passband and stopband edge frequencies.

        For digital filters, these are in the same units as `fs`. By default,
        `fs` is 2 half-cycles/sample, so these are normalized from 0 to 1,
        where 1 is the Nyquist frequency. (`wp` and `ws` are thus in
        half-cycles / sample.)  For example:

            - Lowpass:   wp = 0.2,          ws = 0.3
            - Highpass:  wp = 0.3,          ws = 0.2
            - Bandpass:  wp = [0.2, 0.5],   ws = [0.1, 0.6]
            - Bandstop:  wp = [0.1, 0.6],   ws = [0.2, 0.5]

        For analog filters, `wp` and `ws` are angular frequencies (e.g., rad/s).
    gpass : float
        The maximum loss in the passband (dB).
    gstop : float
        The minimum attenuation in the stopband (dB).
    analog : bool, optional
        When True, return an analog filter, otherwise a digital filter is
        returned.
    fs : float, optional
        The sampling frequency of the digital system.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2.0

    Returns
    -------
    ord : int
        The lowest order for a Chebyshev type I filter that meets specs.
    wn : ndarray or float
        The Chebyshev natural frequency (the "3dB frequency") for use with
        `cheby1` to give filter results. If `fs` is specified,
        this is in the same units, and `fs` must also be passed to `cheby1`.

    N : int
        The order of the filter.
    norm : {'phase', 'delay', 'mag'}, optional
        Frequency normalization:

        ``phase``
            The filter is normalized such that the phase response reaches its
            midpoint at an angular (e.g., rad/s) cutoff frequency of 1. This
            happens for both low-pass and high-pass filters, so this is the

            filter of the same order with a cutoff of `Wn`.

            This is the default, and matches MATLAB's implementation.

        ``delay``
            The filter is normalized such that the group delay in the passband
            is 1 (e.g., 1 second). This is the "natural" type obtained by
            solving Bessel polynomials

        ``mag``
            The filter is normalized such that the gain magnitude is -3 dB at
            angular frequency 1. This is called "frequency normalization" by
            Bond. [1]_

    To find the pole locations, approximate starting points are generated [2]_
    for the zeros of the ordinary Bessel polynomial [3]_, then the
    Aberth-Ehrlich method [4]_ [5]_ is used on the Kv(x) Bessel function to
    calculate more accurate zeros, and these locations are then inverted about
    the unit circle.

def iircomb(w0, Q, ftype='notch', fs=2.0, *, pass_zero=False):
    """
    Design IIR notching or peaking digital comb filter.

    A notching comb filter consists of regularly-spaced band-stop filters with

    band and leaves the rest of the spectrum little changed.

    A peaking comb filter consists of regularly-spaced band-pass filters with
    a narrow bandwidth (high quality factor). Each rejects components outside
    a narrow frequency band.

    Parameters
    ----------
    w0 : float
        The fundamental frequency of the comb filter (the spacing between its
        peaks). This must evenly divide the sampling frequency. If `fs` is
        specified, this is in the same units as `fs`. By default, it is
        a normalized scalar that must satisfy  ``0 < w0 < 1``, with

        notch filter -3 dB bandwidth ``bw`` relative to its center
        frequency, ``Q = w0/bw``.
    ftype : {'notch', 'peak'}
        The type of comb filter generated by the function. If 'notch', then
        the Q factor applies to the notches. If 'peak', then the Q factor
        applies to the peaks.  Default is 'notch'.
    fs : float, optional
        The sampling frequency of the signal. Default is 2.0.
    pass_zero : bool, optional
        If False (default), the notches (nulls) of the filter are centered on
        frequencies [0, w0, 2*w0, ...], and the peaks are centered on the
        midpoints [w0/2, 3*w0/2, 5*w0/2, ...].  If True, the peaks are centered
        on [0, w0, 2*w0, ...] (passing zero frequency) and vice versa.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `w0` is less than or equal to 0 or greater than or equal to

    Notes

    For implementation details, see [1]_. The TF implementation of the
    comb filter is numerically stable even at higher orders due to the
    use of a single repeated pole, which won't suffer from precision loss.
