"""
Python wrappers for Orthogonal Distance Regression (ODRPACK).

Notes
=====

* Array formats -- FORTRAN stores its arrays in memory column first, i.e., an
  array element A(i, j, k) will be next to A(i+1, j, k). In C and, consequently,
  NumPy, arrays are stored row first: A[i, j, k] is next to A[i, j, k+1]. For
  efficiency and convenience, the input and output arrays of the fitting
  function (and its Jacobians) are passed to FORTRAN without transposition.
  Therefore, where the ODRPACK documentation says that the X array is of shape
  (N, M), it will be passed to the Python function as an array of shape (M, N).
  If M==1, the 1-D case, then nothing matters; if M>1, then your
  Python functions will be dealing with arrays that are indexed in reverse of
  the ODRPACK documentation. No real issue, but watch out for your indexing of
  the Jacobians: the i,jth elements (@f_i/@x_j) evaluated at the nth
  observation will be returned as jacd[j, i, n]. Except for the Jacobians, it
  really is easier to deal with x[0] and x[1] than x[:,0] and x[:,1]. Of course,
  you can always use the transpose() function from SciPy explicitly.

* Examples -- See the accompanying file test/test.py for examples of how to set
  up fits of your own. Some are taken from the User's Guide; some are from
  other sources.

* Models -- Some common models are instantiated in the accompanying module
  models.py . Contributions are welcome.

class Data:
    """
    The data to fit.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Observed data for the independent variable of the regression
    y : array_like, optional
        If array-like, observed data for the dependent variable of the
        regression. A scalar input implies that the model to be used on
        the data is implicit.
    we : array_like, optional
        If `we` is a scalar, then that value is used for all data points (and
        all dimensions of the response variable).
        If `we` is a rank-1 array of length q (the dimensionality of the
        response variable), then this vector is the diagonal of the covariant
        weighting matrix for all data points.
        If `we` is a rank-1 array of length n (the number of data points), then
        the i'th element is the weight for the i'th response variable
        observation (single-dimensional only).
        If `we` is a rank-2 array of shape (q, q), then this is the full
        covariant weighting matrix broadcast to each observation.
        If `we` is a rank-2 array of shape (q, n), then `we[:,i]` is the
        diagonal of the covariant weighting matrix for the i'th observation.
        If `we` is a rank-3 array of shape (q, q, n), then `we[:,:,i]` is the
        full specification of the covariant weighting matrix for each
        observation.
        If the fit is implicit, then only a positive scalar value is used.
    wd : array_like, optional
        If `wd` is a scalar, then that value is used for all data points
        (and all dimensions of the input variable). If `wd` = 0, then the
        covariant weighting matrix for each observation is set to the identity
        matrix (so each dimension of each observation has the same weight).
        If `wd` is a rank-1 array of length m (the dimensionality of the input
        variable), then this vector is the diagonal of the covariant weighting
        matrix for all data points.
        If `wd` is a rank-1 array of length n (the number of data points), then
        the i'th element is the weight for the ith input variable observation
        (single-dimensional only).
        If `wd` is a rank-2 array of shape (m, m), then this is the full
        covariant weighting matrix broadcast to each observation.
        If `wd` is a rank-2 array of shape (m, n), then `wd[:,i]` is the
        diagonal of the covariant weighting matrix for the ith observation.
        If `wd` is a rank-3 array of shape (m, m, n), then `wd[:,:,i]` is the
        full specification of the covariant weighting matrix for each
        observation.
    fix : array_like of ints, optional
        The `fix` argument is the same as ifixx in the class ODR. It is an
        array of integers with the same shape as data.x that determines which
        input observations are treated as fixed. One can use a sequence of
        length m (the dimensionality of the input observations) to fix some
        dimensions for all observations. A value of 0 fixes the observation,
        a value > 0 makes it free.
    meta : dict, optional
        Free-form dictionary for metadata.

    Notes
    -----
    Each argument is attached to the member of the instance of the same name.
    The structures of `x` and `y` are described in the Model class docstring.
    If `y` is an integer, then the Data instance can only be used to fit with
    implicit models where the dimensionality of the response is equal to the
    specified value of `y`.

    The `we` argument weights the effect a deviation in the response variable
    has on the fit. The `wd` argument weights the effect a deviation in the
    input variable has on the fit. To handle multidimensional inputs and
    responses easily, the structure of these arguments has the n'th
    dimensional axis first. These arguments heavily use the structured
    arguments feature of ODRPACK to conveniently and flexibly support all
    options. See the ODRPACK User's Guide for a full explanation of how these
    weights are used in the algorithm. Basically, a higher value of the weight
    for a particular data point makes a deviation at that point more
    detrimental to the fit.

    Parameters
    ----------

          fjacd(beta, x) --> @f_i(x,B)/@x_j
    extra_args : tuple, optional
          If specified, `extra_args` should be a tuple of extra

          freeform dictionary of metadata for the model

    Notes
    -----
    Note that the `fcn`, `fjacb`, and `fjacd` operate on NumPy arrays and
    return a NumPy array. The `estimate` object takes an instance of the
    Data class.

    Here are the rules for the shapes of the argument and return
    arrays of the callback functions:

    `x`
        if the input data is single-dimensional, then `x` is rank-1
        array; i.e., ``x = array([1, 2, 3, ...]); x.shape = (n,)``
        If the input data is multi-dimensional, then `x` is a rank-2 array;
        i.e., ``x = array([[1, 2, ...], [2, 4, ...]]); x.shape = (m, n)``.
        In all cases, it has the same shape as the input data array passed to
        `~scipy.odr.odr`. `m` is the dimensionality of the input data,
        `n` is the number of observations.
    `y`
        if the response variable is single-dimensional, then `y` is a
        rank-1 array, i.e., ``y = array([2, 4, ...]); y.shape = (n,)``.
        If the response variable is multi-dimensional, then `y` is a rank-2
        array, i.e., ``y = array([[2, 4, ...], [3, 6, ...]]); y.shape =
        (q, n)`` where `q` is the dimensionality of the response variable.
    `beta`
        rank-1 array of length `p` where `p` is the number of parameters;
        i.e. ``beta = array([B_1, B_2, ..., B_p])``
    `fjacb`
        if the response variable is multi-dimensional, then the
        return array's shape is `(q, p, n)` such that ``fjacb(x,beta)[l,k,i] =
        d f_l(X,B)/d B_k`` evaluated at the ith data point.  If `q == 1`, then
        the return array is only rank-2 and with shape `(p, n)`.
    `fjacd`
        as with fjacb, only the return array's shape is `(q, m, n)`
        such that ``fjacd(x,beta)[l,j,i] = d f_l(X,B)/d X_j`` at the ith data
        point.  If `q == 1`, then the return array's shape is `(m, n)`. If
        `m == 1`, the shape is (q, n). If `m == q == 1`, the shape is `(n,)`.

    The ODR class gathers all information and coordinates the running of the
    main fitting routine.

    Members of instances of the ODR class have the same names as the arguments
    to the initialization routine.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : Data class instance
        instance of the Data class
    model : Model class instance
        instance of the Model class

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    beta0 : array_like of rank-1
        a rank-1 sequence of initial parameter values. Optional if
        model provides an "estimate" function to estimate these values.
    delta0 : array_like of floats of rank-1, optional
        a (double-precision) float array to hold the initial values of
        the errors in the input variables. Must be same shape as data.x
    ifixb : array_like of ints of rank-1, optional
        sequence of integers with the same length as beta0 that determines
        which parameters are held fixed. A value of 0 fixes the parameter,
        a value > 0 makes the parameter free.
    ifixx : array_like of ints with same shape as data.x, optional
        an array of integers with the same shape as data.x that determines
        which input observations are treated as fixed. One can use a sequence
        of length m (the dimensionality of the input observations) to fix some
        dimensions for all observations. A value of 0 fixes the observation,
        a value > 0 makes it free.
    job : int, optional
        an integer telling ODRPACK what tasks to perform. See p. 31 of the
        ODRPACK User's Guide if you absolutely must set the value here. Use the
        method set_job post-initialization for a more readable interface.
    iprint : int, optional
        an integer telling ODRPACK what to print. See pp. 33-34 of the
        ODRPACK User's Guide if you absolutely must set the value here. Use the
        method set_iprint post-initialization for a more readable interface.
    errfile : str, optional
        string with the filename to print ODRPACK errors to. If the file already
        exists, an error will be thrown. The `overwrite` argument can be used to
        prevent this. *Do Not Open This File Yourself!*
    rptfile : str, optional
        string with the filename to print ODRPACK summaries to. If the file
        already exists, an error will be thrown. The `overwrite` argument can be
        used to prevent this. *Do Not Open This File Yourself!*
    ndigit : int, optional
        integer specifying the number of reliable digits in the computation
        of the function.
    taufac : float, optional
        float specifying the initial trust region. The default value is 1.
        The initial trust region is equal to taufac times the length of the
        first computed Gauss-Newton step. taufac must be less than 1.
    sstol : float, optional
        float specifying the tolerance for convergence based on the relative
        change in the sum-of-squares. The default value is eps**(1/2) where eps
        is the smallest value such that 1 + eps > 1 for double precision
        computation on the machine. sstol must be less than 1.
    partol : float, optional
        float specifying the tolerance for convergence based on the relative
        change in the estimated parameters. The default value is eps**(2/3) for
        explicit models and ``eps**(1/3)`` for implicit models. partol must be less
        than 1.
    maxit : int, optional
        integer specifying the maximum number of iterations to perform. For
        first runs, maxit is the total number of iterations performed and
        defaults to 50. For restarts, maxit is the number of additional
        iterations to perform and defaults to 10.
    stpb : array_like, optional
        sequence (``len(stpb) == len(beta0)``) of relative step sizes to compute
        finite difference derivatives wrt the parameters.
    stpd : optional
        array (``stpd.shape == data.x.shape`` or ``stpd.shape == (m,)``) of relative
        step sizes to compute finite difference derivatives wrt the input
        variable errors. If stpd is a rank-1 array with length m (the
        dimensionality of the input variable), then the values are broadcast to
        all observations.
    sclb : array_like, optional
        sequence (``len(stpb) == len(beta0)``) of scaling factors for the
        parameters. The purpose of these scaling factors are to scale all of
        the parameters to around unity. Normally appropriate scaling factors
        are computed if this argument is not specified. Specify them yourself
        if the automatic procedure goes awry.
    scld : array_like, optional
        array (scld.shape == data.x.shape or scld.shape == (m,)) of scaling
        factors for the *errors* in the input variables. Again, these factors
        are automatically computed if you do not provide them. If scld.shape ==
        (m,), then the scaling factors are broadcast to all observations.
    work : ndarray, optional
        array to hold the double-valued working data for ODRPACK. When
        restarting, takes the value of self.output.work.
    iwork : ndarray, optional
        array to hold the integer-valued working data for ODRPACK. When
        restarting, takes the value of self.output.iwork.
    overwrite : bool, optional
        If it is True, output files defined by `errfile` and `rptfile` are
        overwritten. The default is False.

    Attributes
    ----------
    data : Data
        The data for this fit
    model : Model
        The model used in fit
    output : Output
        An instance if the Output class containing all of the returned

        ODRPACK defaults to no printing. If no filename is specified with the
        member rptfile, then ODRPACK prints to stdout. One can tell ODRPACK to
        print to stdout in addition to the specified filename by setting the
        so_* arguments to this function, but one cannot specify to print to
        stdout but not a file since one can do that by not specifying a rptfile
        filename.

        There are three reports: initialization, iteration, and final reports.
        They are represented by the arguments init, iter, and final
        respectively.  The permissible values are 0, 1, and 2 representing "no
        report", "short report", and "long report" respectively.

        The argument iter_step (0 <= iter_step <= 9) specifies how often to make
        the iteration report; the report will be made for every iter_step'th
        iteration starting with iteration one. If iter_step == 0, then no
        iteration report is made, regardless of the other arguments.
