class RecursiveDescentParser(ParserI):
    """
    A simple top-down CFG parser that parses texts by recursively
    expanding the fringe of a Tree, and matching it against a
    text.

    ``RecursiveDescentParser`` uses a list of tree locations called a
    "frontier" to remember which subtrees have not yet been expanded
    and which leaves have not yet been matched against the text.  Each
    tree location consists of a list of child indices specifying the
    path from the root of the tree to a subtree or a leaf; see the
    reference documentation for Tree for more information
    about tree locations.

    When the parser begins parsing a text, it constructs a tree
    containing only the start symbol, and a frontier containing the
    location of the tree's root node.  It then extends the tree to
    cover the text, using the following recursive procedure:

      - If the frontier is empty, and the text is covered by the tree,
        then return the tree as a possible parse.
      - If the frontier is empty, and the text is not covered by the
        tree, then return no parses.
      - If the first element of the frontier is a subtree, then
        use CFG productions to "expand" it.  For each applicable
        production, add the expanded subtree's children to the
        frontier, and recursively find all parses that can be
        generated by the new tree and frontier.
      - If the first element of the frontier is a token, then "match"
        it against the next token from the text.  Remove the token
        from the frontier, and recursively find all parses that can be
        generated by the new tree and frontier.
