    From Wu et al. (2016):
        "The BLEU score has some undesirable properties when used for single
         sentences, as it was designed to be a corpus measure. We therefore
         use a slightly different score for our RL experiments which we call
         the 'GLEU score'. For the GLEU score, we record all sub-sequences of
         1, 2, 3 or 4 tokens in output and target sequence (n-grams). We then
         compute a recall, which is the ratio of the number of matching n-grams
         to the number of total n-grams in the target (ground truth) sequence,
         and a precision, which is the ratio of the number of matching n-grams
         to the number of total n-grams in the generated output sequence. Then
         GLEU score is simply the minimum of recall and precision. This GLEU
         score's range is always between 0 (no matches) and 1 (all match) and
         it is symmetrical when switching output and target. According to
         our experiments, GLEU score correlates quite well with the BLEU
         metric on a corpus level but does not have its drawbacks for our per
         sentence reward objective."

    Note: The initial implementation only allowed a single reference, but now
          a list of references is required (which is consistent with
          bleu_score.sentence_bleu()).

    Calculate a single corpus-level GLEU score (aka. system-level GLEU) for all
    the hypotheses and their respective references.

    Instead of averaging the sentence level GLEU scores (i.e. macro-average
    precision), Wu et al. (2016) sum up the matching tokens and the max of
    hypothesis and reference tokens for each sentence, then compute using the
    aggregate values.

    From Mike Schuster (via email):
        "For the corpus, we just add up the two statistics n_match and
         n_all = max(n_all_output, n_all_target) for all sentences, then
         calculate gleu_score = n_match / n_all, so it is not just a mean of
         the sentence gleu scores (in our case, longer sentences count more,
         which I think makes sense as they are more difficult to translate)."
