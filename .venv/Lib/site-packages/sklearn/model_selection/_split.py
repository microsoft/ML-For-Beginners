    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None

    -----

      classes, or as close as possible.
    * Be invariant to class label: relabelling ``y = ["Happy", "Sad"]`` to
      ``y = [1, 0]`` should not change the indices generated.
    * Preserve order dependencies in the dataset ordering, when
      ``shuffle=False``: all samples from class k in some test set were
      contiguous in y, or separated in y by samples from classes other than k.
    * Generate test sets where the smallest and largest differ by at most one
      sample.

    -----
    The implementation is designed to:

    * Mimic the behavior of StratifiedKFold as much as possible for trivial
      groups (e.g. when each group contains only one sample).
    * Be invariant to class label: relabelling ``y = ["Happy", "Sad"]`` to
      ``y = [1, 0]`` should not change the indices generated.
    * Stratify based on samples as much as possible while keeping
      non-overlapping groups constraint. That means that in some cases when
      there is a small number of groups containing a large number of samples
      the stratification will not be possible and the behavior will be close
      to GroupKFold.

    Provides randomized train/test indices to split data according to a

    arbitrary domain specific stratifications of the samples as integers.

    For instance the groups could be the year of collection of the samples
    and thus allow for cross-validation against time-based splits.

    The difference between LeavePGroupsOut and GroupShuffleSplit is that
    the former generates splits using all subsets of size ``p`` unique groups,
    whereas GroupShuffleSplit generates a user-determined number of random
    test splits, each with a user-determined fraction of unique groups.

    For example, a less computationally intensive alternative to
    ``LeavePGroupsOut(p=10)`` would be
    ``GroupShuffleSplit(test_size=10, n_splits=100)``.

    Note: The parameters ``test_size`` and ``train_size`` refer to groups, and
    not to samples, as in ShuffleSplit.

        represents the absolute number of test groups. If None, the value is
        set to the complement of the train size.
        The default will change in version 0.21. It will remain 0.2 only
        if ``train_size`` is unspecified, otherwise it will complement
        the specified ``train_size``.

    train_size : float or int, default=None
