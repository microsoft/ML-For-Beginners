"""Mean shift clustering algorithm.

Mean shift clustering aims to discover *blobs* in a smooth density of
samples. It is a centroid based algorithm, which works by updating candidates
for centroids to be the mean of the points within a given region. These
candidates are then filtered in a post-processing stage to eliminate
near-duplicates to form the final set of centroids.

Seeding is performed using a binning technique for scalability.

    Parameters
    ----------

    X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Input data.

    bandwidth : float, default=None
        Kernel bandwidth. If not None, must be in the range [0, +inf).

        If None, the bandwidth is determined using a heuristic based on
        the median of all pairwise distances. This will take quadratic time in
        the number of samples. The sklearn.cluster.estimate_bandwidth function
        can be used to do this more efficiently.

    seeds : array-like of shape (n_seeds, n_features) or None
        Point used as initial kernel locations. If None and bin_seeding=False,
        each data point is used as a seed. If None and bin_seeding=True,
        see bin_seeding.

    bin_seeding : bool, default=False
        If true, initial kernel locations are not locations of all
        points, but rather the location of the discretized version of
        points, where points are binned onto a grid whose coarseness
        corresponds to the bandwidth. Setting this option to True will speed
        up the algorithm because fewer seeds will be initialized.
        Ignored if seeds argument is not None.

    min_bin_freq : int, default=1
       To speed up the algorithm, accept only those bins with at least
       min_bin_freq points as seeds.

    cluster_all : bool, default=True
        If true, then all points are clustered, even those orphans that are
        not within any kernel. Orphans are assigned to the nearest kernel.
        If false, then orphans are given cluster label -1.

    max_iter : int, default=300
        Maximum number of iterations, per seed point before the clustering
        operation terminates (for that seed point), if has not converged yet.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to use for the computation. The following tasks benefit
        from the parallelization:

        - The search of nearest neighbors for bandwidth estimation and label
          assignments. See the details in the docstring of the
          ``NearestNeighbors`` class.
        - Hill-climbing optimization for all seeds.

        See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>` for more details.

    Notes
    -----

    Scalability:

    Because this implementation uses a flat kernel and
    a Ball Tree to look up members of each kernel, the complexity will tend
    towards O(T*n*log(n)) in lower dimensions, with n the number of samples
    and T the number of points. In higher dimensions the complexity will
    tend towards O(T*n^2).

    Scalability can be boosted by using fewer seeds, for example by using
    a higher value of min_bin_freq in the get_bin_seeds function.

    Note that the estimate_bandwidth function is much less scalable than the
    mean shift algorithm and will be the bottleneck if it is used.
