# Machine learning module for Python
# ==================================
#
# sklearn is a Python module integrating classical machine
# learning algorithms in the tightly-knit world of scientific Python
# packages (numpy, scipy, matplotlib).
#
# It aims to provide simple and efficient solutions to learning problems
# that are accessible to everybody and reusable in various contexts:
# machine-learning as a versatile tool for science and engineering.
#
# See http://scikit-learn.org for complete documentation.

# PEP0440 compatible formatted version, see:

# Generic release markers:
#   X.Y.0   # For first release after an increment in Y
#   X.Y.Z   # For bugfix releases
#
# Admissible pre-release markers:
#   X.Y.ZaN   # Alpha release

# Dev branch marker is: 'X.Y.dev' or 'X.Y.devN' where N is an integer.
# 'X.Y.dev0' is the canonical version of 'X.Y.dev'

# On OSX, we can get a runtime error due to multiple OpenMP libraries loaded
# simultaneously. This can happen for instance when calling BLAS inside a
# prange. Setting the following environment variable allows multiple OpenMP
# libraries to be loaded. It should not degrade performances since we manually
# take care of potential over-subcription performance issues, in sections of
# the code where nested OpenMP loops can happen, by dynamically reconfiguring
# the inner OpenMP runtime to temporarily disable it while under the scope of
# the outer OpenMP parallel section.
