Diabetes dataset
----------------

Ten baseline variables, age, sex, body mass index, average blood
pressure, and six blood serum measurements were obtained for each of n =
442 diabetes patients, as well as the response of interest, a
quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

**Data Set Characteristics:**

  :Number of Instances: 442

  :Number of Attributes: First 10 columns are numeric predictive values

  :Target: Column 11 is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline

  :Attribute Information:
      - age     age in years
      - sex
      - bmi     body mass index
      - bp      average blood pressure
      - s1      tc, total serum cholesterol
      - s2      ldl, low-density lipoproteins
      - s3      hdl, high-density lipoproteins
      - s4      tch, total cholesterol / HDL
      - s5      ltg, possibly log of serum triglycerides level
      - s6      glu, blood sugar level

Note: Each of these 10 feature variables have been mean centered and scaled by the standard deviation times the square root of `n_samples` (i.e. the sum of squares of each column totals 1).
