Kddcup 99 dataset
-----------------

The KDD Cup '99 dataset was created by processing the tcpdump portions
of the 1998 DARPA Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Evaluation dataset,
created by MIT Lincoln Lab [2]_. The artificial data (described on the `dataset's
homepage <https://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html>`_) was
generated using a closed network and hand-injected attacks to produce a
large number of different types of attack with normal activity in the
background. As the initial goal was to produce a large training set for
supervised learning algorithms, there is a large proportion (80.1%) of
abnormal data which is unrealistic in real world, and inappropriate for
unsupervised anomaly detection which aims at detecting 'abnormal' data, i.e.:

* qualitatively different from normal data
* in large minority among the observations.

We thus transform the KDD Data set into two different data sets: SA and SF.

* SA is obtained by simply selecting all the normal data, and a small
  proportion of abnormal data to gives an anomaly proportion of 1%.

* SF is obtained as in [3]_
  by simply picking up the data whose attribute logged_in is positive, thus
  focusing on the intrusion attack, which gives a proportion of 0.3% of
  attack.

* http and smtp are two subsets of SF corresponding with third feature
  equal to 'http' (resp. to 'smtp').

:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_kddcup99` will load the kddcup99 dataset; it
returns a dictionary-like object with the feature matrix in the ``data`` member
and the target values in ``target``. The "as_frame" optional argument converts
``data`` into a pandas DataFrame and ``target`` into a pandas Series. The
dataset will be downloaded from the web if necessary.
