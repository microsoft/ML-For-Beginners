              the artist.

            - A float: If picker is a number it is interpreted as an
              epsilon tolerance in points and the artist will fire
              off an event if its data is within epsilon of the mouse
              event.  For some artists like lines and patch collections,
              the artist may provide additional data to the pick event
              that is generated, e.g., the indices of the data within
              epsilon of the pick event

            - A function: If picker is callable, it is a user supplied
              function which determines whether the artist is hit by the
              mouse event::

        value, so that the resulting image will really contain a 1px wide

        ``x`` and ``y`` sticky edge lists for autoscaling.

        When performing autoscaling, if a data limit coincides with a value in
        the corresponding sticky_edges list, then no margin will be added--the
        view limit "sticks" to the edge. A typical use case is histograms,
        where one usually expects no margin on the bottom edge (0) of the
        histogram.

        Moreover, margin expansion "bumps" against sticky edges and cannot
        cross them.  For example, if the upper data limit is 1.0, the upper
        view limit computed by simple margin application is 1.2, but there is a
        sticky edge at 1.1, then the actual upper view limit will be 1.1.

    Return the value of an `.Artist`'s *property*, or print all of them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : `~matplotlib.artist.Artist`
        The queried artist; e.g., a `.Line2D`, a `.Text`, or an `~.axes.Axes`.

    property : str or None, default: None
        If *property* is 'somename', this function returns
        ``obj.get_somename()``.

        If it's None (or unset), it *prints* all gettable properties from
        *obj*.  Many properties have aliases for shorter typing, e.g. 'lw' is
        an alias for 'linewidth'.  In the output, aliases and full property
        names will be listed as:

          property or alias = value

    Set one or more properties on an `.Artist`, or list allowed values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : `~matplotlib.artist.Artist` or list of `.Artist`
        The artist(s) whose properties are being set or queried.  When setting
        properties, all artists are affected; when querying the allowed values,
        only the first instance in the sequence is queried.

        For example, two lines can be made thicker and red with a single call:

        >>> x = arange(0, 1, 0.01)
        >>> lines = plot(x, sin(2*pi*x), x, sin(4*pi*x))
        >>> setp(lines, linewidth=2, color='r')

    file : file-like, default: `sys.stdout`
        Where `setp` writes its output when asked to list allowed values.

        >>> with open('output.log') as file:
        ...     setp(line, file=file)

        The default, ``None``, means `sys.stdout`.

    *args, **kwargs
        The properties to set.  The following combinations are supported:

        - Set the linestyle of a line to be dashed:

          >>> line, = plot([1, 2, 3])
          >>> setp(line, linestyle='--')

        - Set multiple properties at once:

          >>> setp(line, linewidth=2, color='r')

        - List allowed values for a line's linestyle:

          >>> setp(line, 'linestyle')
          linestyle: {'-', '--', '-.', ':', '', (offset, on-off-seq), ...}

        - List all properties that can be set, and their allowed values:

          >>> setp(line)
          agg_filter: a filter function, ...
          [long output listing omitted]

        `setp` also supports MATLAB style string/value pairs.  For example, the
        following are equivalent:

        >>> setp(lines, 'linewidth', 2, 'color', 'r')  # MATLAB style
        >>> setp(lines, linewidth=2, color='r')        # Python style
