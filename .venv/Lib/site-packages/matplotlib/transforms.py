"""
Matplotlib includes a framework for arbitrary geometric
transformations that is used determine the final position of all
elements drawn on the canvas.

Transforms are composed into trees of `TransformNode` objects
whose actual value depends on their children.  When the contents of
children change, their parents are automatically invalidated.  The
next time an invalidated transform is accessed, it is recomputed to
reflect those changes.  This invalidation/caching approach prevents
unnecessary recomputations of transforms, and contributes to better
interactive performance.

For example, here is a graph of the transform tree used to plot data
to the graph:

.. image:: ../_static/transforms.png

The framework can be used for both affine and non-affine
transformations.  However, for speed, we want to use the backend
renderers to perform affine transformations whenever possible.
Therefore, it is possible to perform just the affine or non-affine
part of a transformation on a set of data.  The affine is always
assumed to occur after the non-affine.  For any transform::

  full transform == non-affine part + affine part

The backends are not expected to handle non-affine transformations
themselves.

See the tutorial :ref:`transforms_tutorial` for examples
of how to use transforms.

class Bbox(BboxBase):
    """
    A mutable bounding box.

    Examples
    --------
    **Create from known bounds**

    The default constructor takes the boundary "points" ``[[xmin, ymin],
    [xmax, ymax]]``.

        >>> Bbox([[1, 1], [3, 7]])
        Bbox([[1.0, 1.0], [3.0, 7.0]])

    Alternatively, a Bbox can be created from the flattened points array, the
    so-called "extents" ``(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)``

        >>> Bbox.from_extents(1, 1, 3, 7)
        Bbox([[1.0, 1.0], [3.0, 7.0]])

    or from the "bounds" ``(xmin, ymin, width, height)``.

        >>> Bbox.from_bounds(1, 1, 2, 6)
        Bbox([[1.0, 1.0], [3.0, 7.0]])

    **Create from collections of points**

    The "empty" object for accumulating Bboxs is the null bbox, which is a
    stand-in for the empty set.

        >>> Bbox.null()
        Bbox([[inf, inf], [-inf, -inf]])

    Adding points to the null bbox will give you the bbox of those points.

        >>> box = Bbox.null()
        >>> box.update_from_data_xy([[1, 1]])
        >>> box
        Bbox([[1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0]])
        >>> box.update_from_data_xy([[2, 3], [3, 2]], ignore=False)
        >>> box
        Bbox([[1.0, 1.0], [3.0, 3.0]])

    Setting ``ignore=True`` is equivalent to starting over from a null bbox.

        >>> box.update_from_data_xy([[1, 1]], ignore=True)
        >>> box
        Bbox([[1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0]])

    .. warning::

        It is recommended to always specify ``ignore`` explicitly.  If not, the
        default value of ``ignore`` can be changed at any time by code with
        access to your Bbox, for example using the method `~.Bbox.ignore`.

    **Properties of the ``null`` bbox**

    .. note::

        The current behavior of `Bbox.null()` may be surprising as it does
        not have all of the properties of the "empty set", and as such does
        not behave like a "zero" object in the mathematical sense. We may
        change that in the future (with a deprecation period).

    The null bbox is the identity for intersections

        >>> Bbox.intersection(Bbox([[1, 1], [3, 7]]), Bbox.null())
        Bbox([[1.0, 1.0], [3.0, 7.0]])

    except with itself, where it returns the full space.

        >>> Bbox.intersection(Bbox.null(), Bbox.null())
        Bbox([[-inf, -inf], [inf, inf]])

    A union containing null will always return the full space (not the other
    set!)

        >>> Bbox.union([Bbox([[0, 0], [0, 0]]), Bbox.null()])
        Bbox([[-inf, -inf], [inf, inf]])

    A transform wrapper for transforming displacements between pairs of points.

    This class is intended to be used to transform displacements ("position
    deltas") between pairs of points (e.g., as the ``offset_transform``
    of `.Collection`\s): given a transform ``t`` such that ``t =
    AffineDeltaTransform(t) + offset``, ``AffineDeltaTransform``
    satisfies ``AffineDeltaTransform(a - b) == AffineDeltaTransform(a) -
    AffineDeltaTransform(b)``.

    This is implemented by forcing the offset components of the transform
    matrix to zero.

    This class is experimental as of 3.3, and the API may change.
