r"""
A module for dealing with the polylines used throughout Matplotlib.

The primary class for polyline handling in Matplotlib is `Path`.  Almost all
vector drawing makes use of `Path`\s somewhere in the drawing pipeline.

Whilst a `Path` instance itself cannot be drawn, some `.Artist` subclasses,
such as `.PathPatch` and `.PathCollection`, can be used for convenient `Path`
visualisation.

class Path:
    """
    A series of possibly disconnected, possibly closed, line and curve
    segments.

    The underlying storage is made up of two parallel numpy arrays:

    - *vertices*: an (N, 2) float array of vertices
    - *codes*: an N-length `numpy.uint8` array of path codes, or None

    These two arrays always have the same length in the first
    dimension.  For example, to represent a cubic curve, you must
    provide three vertices and three `CURVE4` codes.

    The code types are:

    - `STOP`   :  1 vertex (ignored)
        A marker for the end of the entire path (currently not required and
        ignored)

    - `MOVETO` :  1 vertex
        Pick up the pen and move to the given vertex.

    - `LINETO` :  1 vertex
        Draw a line from the current position to the given vertex.

    - `CURVE3` :  1 control point, 1 endpoint
        Draw a quadratic Bézier curve from the current position, with the given
        control point, to the given end point.

    - `CURVE4` :  2 control points, 1 endpoint
        Draw a cubic Bézier curve from the current position, with the given
        control points, to the given end point.

    - `CLOSEPOLY` : 1 vertex (ignored)
        Draw a line segment to the start point of the current polyline.

    If *codes* is None, it is interpreted as a `MOVETO` followed by a series
    of `LINETO`.

    Users of Path objects should not access the vertices and codes arrays
    directly.  Instead, they should use `iter_segments` or `cleaned` to get the
    vertex/code pairs.  This helps, in particular, to consistently handle the
    case of *codes* being None.

    Some behavior of Path objects can be controlled by rcParams. See the
    rcParams whose keys start with 'path.'.

    .. note::

        The vertices and codes arrays should be treated as
        immutable -- there are a number of optimizations and assumptions
        made up front in the constructor that will not change when the
        data changes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    master_transform : `~matplotlib.transforms.Transform`
        Global transformation applied to all paths.
    paths : list of `Path`
    transforms : list of `~matplotlib.transforms.Affine2DBase`

    offset_transform : `~matplotlib.transforms.Affine2DBase`
        Transform applied to the offsets before offsetting the path.

    Notes
    -----
    The way that *paths*, *transforms* and *offsets* are combined follows the same
    method as for collections: each is iterated over independently, so if you have 3
    paths (A, B, C), 2 transforms (α, β) and 1 offset (O), their combinations are as
    follows:

    - (B, β, O)
