"""
A fully functional, do-nothing backend intended as a template for backend
writers.  It is fully functional in that you can select it as a backend e.g.
with ::

    import matplotlib
    matplotlib.use("template")

and your program will (should!) run without error, though no output is
produced.  This provides a starting point for backend writers; you can
selectively implement drawing methods (`~.RendererTemplate.draw_path`,
`~.RendererTemplate.draw_image`, etc.) and slowly see your figure come to life
instead having to have a full-blown implementation before getting any results.

Copy this file to a directory outside the Matplotlib source tree, somewhere
where Python can import it (by adding the directory to your ``sys.path`` or by
packaging it as a normal Python package); if the backend is importable as
``import my.backend`` you can then select it using ::

    import matplotlib
    matplotlib.use("module://my.backend")

If your backend implements support for saving figures (i.e. has a `print_xyz`
method), you can register it as the default handler for a given file type::

    from matplotlib.backend_bases import register_backend
    register_backend('xyz', 'my_backend', 'XYZ File Format')
    ...
    plt.savefig("figure.xyz")

    The graphics context provides the color, line styles, etc.  See the cairo
    and postscript backends for examples of mapping the graphics context
    attributes (cap styles, join styles, line widths, colors) to a particular
    backend.  In cairo this is done by wrapping a cairo.Context object and
    forwarding the appropriate calls to it using a dictionary mapping styles
    to gdk constants.  In Postscript, all the work is done by the renderer,
    mapping line styles to postscript calls.

    If it's more appropriate to do the mapping at the renderer level (as in
    the postscript backend), you don't need to override any of the GC methods.
    If it's more appropriate to wrap an instance (as in the cairo backend) and
    do the mapping here, you'll need to override several of the setter
    methods.

    The base GraphicsContext stores colors as an RGB tuple on the unit
    interval, e.g., (0.5, 0.0, 1.0). You may need to map this to colors
    appropriate for your backend.
