    Sankey diagram.

      Sankey diagrams are a specific type of flow diagram, in which
      the width of the arrows is shown proportionally to the flow
      quantity.  They are typically used to visualize energy or
      material or cost transfers between processes.

        Create a new Sankey instance.

        The optional arguments listed below are applied to all subdiagrams so
        that there is consistent alignment and formatting.

        In order to draw a complex Sankey diagram, create an instance of
        `Sankey` by calling it without any kwargs::

            sankey = Sankey()

        Then add simple Sankey sub-diagrams::

            sankey.add() # 1
            sankey.add() # 2
            #...
            sankey.add() # n

        Finally, create the full diagram::

            sankey.finish()

        Or, instead, simply daisy-chain those calls::

            Sankey().add().add...  .add().finish()

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        ax : `~matplotlib.axes.Axes`
            Axes onto which the data should be plotted.  If *ax* isn't
            provided, new Axes will be created.
        scale : float
            Scaling factor for the flows.  *scale* sizes the width of the paths
            in order to maintain proper layout.  The same scale is applied to
            all subdiagrams.  The value should be chosen such that the product
            of the scale and the sum of the inputs is approximately 1.0 (and
            the product of the scale and the sum of the outputs is
            approximately -1.0).
        unit : str
            The physical unit associated with the flow quantities.  If *unit*
            is None, then none of the quantities are labeled.
        format : str or callable
            A Python number formatting string or callable used to label the
            flows with their quantities (i.e., a number times a unit, where the
            unit is given). If a format string is given, the label will be
            ``format % quantity``. If a callable is given, it will be called
            with ``quantity`` as an argument.
        gap : float
            Space between paths that break in/break away to/from the top or
            bottom.
        radius : float
            Inner radius of the vertical paths.
        shoulder : float
            Size of the shoulders of output arrows.
        offset : float
            Text offset (from the dip or tip of the arrow).
        head_angle : float
            Angle, in degrees, of the arrow heads (and negative of the angle of
            the tails).
        margin : float
            Minimum space between Sankey outlines and the edge of the plot
            area.
        tolerance : float
            Acceptable maximum of the magnitude of the sum of flows.  The
            magnitude of the sum of connected flows cannot be greater than
            *tolerance*.
        **kwargs
            Any additional keyword arguments will be passed to `add`, which
            will create the first subdiagram.

            List of orientations of the flows (or a single orientation to be
            used for all flows).  Valid values are 0 (inputs from
            the left, outputs to the right), 1 (from and to the top) or -1
            (from and to the bottom).

        labels : list of (str or None)
            List of labels for the flows (or a single label to be used for all
            flows).  Each label may be *None* (no label), or a labeling string.
            If an entry is a (possibly empty) string, then the quantity for the
            corresponding flow will be shown below the string.  However, if
            the *unit* of the main diagram is None, then quantities are never
            shown, regardless of the value of this argument.

        trunklength : float
            Length between the bases of the input and output groups (in
            data-space units).

        pathlengths : list of float
            List of lengths of the vertical arrows before break-in or after
            break-away.  If a single value is given, then it will be applied to
            the first (inside) paths on the top and bottom, and the length of
            all other arrows will be justified accordingly.  The *pathlengths*
            are not applied to the horizontal inputs and outputs.

        prior : int
            Index of the prior diagram to which this diagram should be
            connected.

        connect : (int, int)
            A (prior, this) tuple indexing the flow of the prior diagram and
            the flow of this diagram which should be connected.  If this is the
            first diagram or *prior* is *None*, *connect* will be ignored.

        rotation : float
            Angle of rotation of the diagram in degrees.  The interpretation of
            the *orientations* argument will be rotated accordingly (e.g., if
            *rotation* == 90, an *orientations* entry of 1 means to/from the
            left).  *rotation* is ignored if this diagram is connected to an
            existing one (using *prior* and *connect*).

        Returns a list of subdiagrams with the following fields:

        ========  =============================================================
        Field     Description
        ========  =============================================================
        *patch*   Sankey outline (a `~matplotlib.patches.PathPatch`).
        *flows*   Flow values (positive for input, negative for output).
        *angles*  List of angles of the arrows [deg/90].
                  For example, if the diagram has not been rotated,
                  an input to the top side has an angle of 3 (DOWN),
                  and an output from the top side has an angle of 1 (UP).
                  If a flow has been skipped (because its magnitude is less
                  than *tolerance*), then its angle will be *None*.
        *tips*    (N, 2)-array of the (x, y) positions of the tips (or "dips")
                  of the flow paths.
                  If the magnitude of a flow is less the *tolerance* of this
                  `Sankey` instance, the flow is skipped and its tip will be at
                  the center of the diagram.
        *text*    `.Text` instance for the diagram label.
        *texts*   List of `.Text` instances for the flow labels.
