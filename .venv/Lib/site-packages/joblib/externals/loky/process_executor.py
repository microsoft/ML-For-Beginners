# Re-implementation of the ProcessPoolExecutor more robust to faults
#
# author: Thomas Moreau and Olivier Grisel
#
# adapted from concurrent/futures/process_pool_executor.py (17/02/2017)
#  * Add an extra management thread to detect executor_manager_thread failures,
#  * Improve the shutdown process to avoid deadlocks,
#  * Add timeout for workers,
#  * More robust pickling process.

Executor.submit() called:
- creates a uniquely numbered _WorkItem and adds it to the "Work Items" dict
- adds the id of the _WorkItem to the "Work Ids" queue

Local worker thread:
- reads work ids from the "Work Ids" queue and looks up the corresponding
  WorkItem from the "Work Items" dict: if the work item has been cancelled then
  it is simply removed from the dict, otherwise it is repackaged as a
  _CallItem and put in the "Call Q". New _CallItems are put in the "Call Q"
  until "Call Q" is full. NOTE: the size of the "Call Q" is kept small because
  calls placed in the "Call Q" can no longer be cancelled with Future.cancel().
- reads _ResultItems from "Result Q", updates the future stored in the
  "Work Items" dict and deletes the dict entry

Process #1..n:
- reads _CallItems from "Call Q", executes the calls, and puts the resulting
  _ResultItems in "Result Q"
