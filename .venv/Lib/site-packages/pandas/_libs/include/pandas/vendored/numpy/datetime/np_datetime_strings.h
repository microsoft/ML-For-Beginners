/* 'format_requirement' can be one of three values:

 *           For example, if the string is '2020-01-01 05:00:00' and
 *           'format' is '%Y-%m-%d', then parse '2020-01-01';
 *      * EXACT_MATCH : require an exact match with 'format'. If the
 *           string is '2020-01-01', then the only format which will
 *           be able to parse it without error is '%Y-%m-%d';
 *      * INFER_FORMAT: parse without comparing 'format' (i.e. infer it).

/*
 * Parses (almost) standard ISO 8601 date strings. The differences are:
 *
 * + The date "20100312" is parsed as the year 20100312, not as
 *   equivalent to "2010-03-12". The '-' in the dates are not optional.
 * + Only seconds may have a decimal point, with up to 18 digits after it
 *   (maximum attoseconds precision).
 * + Either a 'T' as in ISO 8601 or a ' ' may be used to separate
 *   the date and the time. Both are treated equivalently.
 * + Doesn't (yet) handle the "YYYY-DDD" or "YYYY-Www" formats.
 * + Doesn't handle leap seconds (seconds value has 60 in these cases).
 * + Doesn't handle 24:00:00 as synonym for midnight (00:00:00) tomorrow
 * + Accepts special values "NaT" (not a time), "Today", (current
 *   day according to local time) and "Now" (current time in UTC).
 *
 * 'str' must be a NULL-terminated string, and 'len' must be its length.
 *
 * 'out' gets filled with the parsed date-time.
 * 'out_local' gets whether returned value contains timezone. 0 for UTC, 1 for local time.
 * 'out_tzoffset' gets set to timezone offset by minutes
 *      if the parsed time was in local time,
 *      to 0 otherwise. The values 'now' and 'today' don't get counted
 *      as local, and neither do UTC +/-#### timezone offsets, because
 *      they aren't using the computer's local timezone offset.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success, -1 on failure.
