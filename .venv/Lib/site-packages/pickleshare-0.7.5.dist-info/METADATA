PickleShare - a small 'shelve' like datastore with concurrency support

Like shelve, a PickleShareDB object acts like a normal dictionary. Unlike shelve,
many processes can access the database simultaneously. Changing a value in 
database is immediately visible to other processes accessing the same database.

Concurrency is possible because the values are stored in separate files. Hence
the "database" is a directory where *all* files are governed by PickleShare.

Example usage::

    from pickleshare import *
    db = PickleShareDB('~/testpickleshare')
    db.clear()
    print("Should be empty:",db.items())
    db['hello'] = 15
    db['aku ankka'] = [1,2,313]
    db['paths/are/ok/key'] = [1,(5,46)]
    print(db.keys())

This module is certainly not ZODB, but can be used for low-load
(non-mission-critical) situations where tiny code size trumps the 
advanced features of a "real" object database.

Installation guide: pip install pickleshare
