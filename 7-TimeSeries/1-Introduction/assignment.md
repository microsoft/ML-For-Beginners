# Visualize some more Time Series

## Instructions

You've begun to learn about Time Series Forecasting by looking at the type of data that requires this special modeling. You've visualized some data around energy. Now, look around for some other data that would benefit from Time Series Forecasting. Find three examples (try [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) and [Azure Open Datasets](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/open-datasets/catalog/?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-leestott)) and create a notebook to visualize them. Notate any special characteristics they have (seasonality, abrupt changes, or other trends) in the notebook.
